<p>Lead has long been recognized as a hazardous environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " primary environmental threat to the health of children in the United States." There are numerous methods which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, degrading paint, and dust. When a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead gets in the body. Prior to it was understood how hazardous lead might be, it was utilized in paint, gasoline, pipes, and lots of other items.<p>
<p>Prior to you go out and purchase an air conditioning unit, there are a few things to decide initially. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioning system? If your home is not equipped with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How big should the a/c unit be?

When shopping for a new AC system, these are simply a few of the factors that you need to take into account.

<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems.

High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
