<h3>Furnace Company in Cayuga NY</h3>
<p>We contacted Elite HVACS on one of the hottest days of summertime( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out same day to assess circumstance & chose to go with them for the work. I am happy to say that not only did we get the central air going but likewise changed the heating unit which was old. Everybody we spoke to from starting to end were really expert, courteous and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces are usually not really effective. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, but a lot of do not achieve an effectiveness greater than 90%. A couple of high-end brands have an effectiveness of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more expensive, having starting costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Due to the fact that a drain needs to be installed, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
<p>I am very satisfied with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company several years earlier and know the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
