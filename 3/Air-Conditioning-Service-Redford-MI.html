Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the reduced air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil.

Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it.
