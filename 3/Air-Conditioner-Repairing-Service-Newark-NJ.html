<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace at Newark NJ?</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system. We chose getting something more pricey than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant energy expenditures. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
