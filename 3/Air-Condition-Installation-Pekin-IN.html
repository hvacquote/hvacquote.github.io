<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The cost for heatpump installation likewise depends upon the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, range in cost from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heat pumps usually require excavation to install, which adds a number of thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the problem, all the while describing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working properly. He needed to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
