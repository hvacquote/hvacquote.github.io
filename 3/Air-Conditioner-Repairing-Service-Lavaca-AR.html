<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, especially if the objective of owning a service was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to construct business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't completion objective. HVAC business owners need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>

This is far more affordable on a smaller sized scale. Larger renovations like additions to a house might appropriate for a bigger scale and more expensive hydronic system.<p>
