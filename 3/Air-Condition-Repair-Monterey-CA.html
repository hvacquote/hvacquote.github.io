Likewise, if the a/c smells bad, there could be germs buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat away from your house. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the air conditioning unit's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump cost is far more than other heat pump types when installing the entire system. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.
