<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace in Abbeville SC</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
