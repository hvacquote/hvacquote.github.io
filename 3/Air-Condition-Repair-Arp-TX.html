<p>Another method to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming inside your home. Most home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen area fans that tire outdoors eliminate pollutants directly from the room where the fan lies and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>

An expert maintenance technician will flush and clean up the condensate drain to ensure all excess wetness streams far from the system.<p>
