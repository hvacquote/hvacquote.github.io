They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to order it. My better half said that she had actually seen a great evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He provided to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good people I have satisfied in a very long time.
