<p>Some biological contaminants activate allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some kinds of asthma. Transmittable diseases, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Molds and mildews release disease-causing contaminants. Signs of health problems brought on by biological pollutants consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, lethargy, fever, and gastrointestinal problems.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by animals and individuals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
