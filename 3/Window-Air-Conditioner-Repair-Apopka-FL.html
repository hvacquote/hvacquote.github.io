<p>New furnaces are substantially more effective than those of ten or more years ago, cutting expenses by as much as 30%.

Our NATE-certified technicians will appropriately fit your equipment to match your size requirements, installation space, and ductwork.

<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in Apopka FL?</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a reference in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
