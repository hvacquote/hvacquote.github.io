<h3>Designing Tips to Central Heating Systems in Salemburg NC</h3>

<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>I am very impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years earlier and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
