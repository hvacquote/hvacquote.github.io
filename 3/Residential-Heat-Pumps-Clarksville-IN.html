<p>Although commercial geothermal systems have actually been in existence because the mid-90s, and the concept developed much earlier than that, its application in houses is still reasonably brand-new.

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

Throughout high use months, examine the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
