<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that just an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the tools or abilities needed to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and correct air flow are vital to a well-functioning system, but house owners lack the essential devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician check the system occasionally.<p>
