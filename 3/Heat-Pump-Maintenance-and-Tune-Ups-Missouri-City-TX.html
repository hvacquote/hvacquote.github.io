<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment.

It also avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
