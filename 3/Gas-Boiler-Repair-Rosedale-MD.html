<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
