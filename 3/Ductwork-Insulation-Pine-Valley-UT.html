<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you may wish to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities. If you currently have a home heating unit, you might try to find a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capacity and effectiveness. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to try to find a design that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters. The good news is that the one major disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the incredibly hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
