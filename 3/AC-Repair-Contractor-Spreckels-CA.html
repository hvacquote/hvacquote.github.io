<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide automobile debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
