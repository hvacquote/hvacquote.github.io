Thus, making certain the air is of good quality is the employer's responsibility.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
