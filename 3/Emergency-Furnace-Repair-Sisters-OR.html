<p>Instant discounts on high-efficiency heatpump innovations are available to devices installers, applied at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Outstanding Client Service! Climate Pro is trustworthy and really cared about us and our circumstance. We came home one night to a cold home. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came by that same night. Although he didn't have actually the needed replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he could search for and buy it the next early morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely happy to have a heated home again. What's most incredible was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to help us right before a vacation, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will happily recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
