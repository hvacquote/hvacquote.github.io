<p>Particular immediate results are similar to those from colds or other viral illness, so it is often difficult to figure out if the signs are a result of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is very important to take notice of the time and location the symptoms take place. If the symptoms fade or disappear when a person is away from the home and return when the person returns, an effort must be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes.

<p>Some diseases, like humidifier fever, are associated with direct exposure to toxins from bacteria that can grow in large building ventilation systems.
