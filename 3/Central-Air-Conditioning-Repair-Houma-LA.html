<p>Expert heating system setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately stop working. HVAC specialists recommend following this fundamental guideline when choosing whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than necessary.<p>
