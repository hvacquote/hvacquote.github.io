<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to individual bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
