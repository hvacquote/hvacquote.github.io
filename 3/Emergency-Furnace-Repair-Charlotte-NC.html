<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor system as near to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
