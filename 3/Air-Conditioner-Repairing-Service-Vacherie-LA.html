<h3>Air Conditioning And Refrigeration in Vacherie LA</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>There are a few possibilities to explain short cycling in extremely cold weather. The most obvious is the possibility of the high demands put on the system due to the extremely low temperatures. Often, the furnace will simply run harder to maintain a warm climate for your home when the weather is very cold. There are other possibilities such as a crack in the heat exchanger or a damaged thermostat. If you need clearness on this concern, contact one of our technicians.<p>
