<p>Indoor impurities. These include chemicals utilized in the construction or renovation of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these home appliances (cook ranges, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor impurities.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The objective is to provide enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical component needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
