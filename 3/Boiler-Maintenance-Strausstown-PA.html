Cool operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its appearances in the start. But then realized A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He understood simply what the issue was and repaired it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
