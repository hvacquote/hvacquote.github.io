<p>Reality: Geothermal systems really consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are extremely uncommon now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>Another option to oil heaters are gas heating systems While oil is generally utilized in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have an option in between the two types.

Heating with gas expenses around $540 a year, instead of the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
