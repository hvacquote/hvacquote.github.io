<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
