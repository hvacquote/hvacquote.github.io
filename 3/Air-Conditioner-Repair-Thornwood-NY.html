<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace issues.

Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
