<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
