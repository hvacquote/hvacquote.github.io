Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your danger of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
