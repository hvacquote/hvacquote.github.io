<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate excellent but Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized.

<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in Semmes AL?</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>

<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Semmes AL</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
