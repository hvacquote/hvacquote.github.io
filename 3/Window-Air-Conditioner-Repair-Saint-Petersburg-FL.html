<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like extended vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to effectively service and the system has actually been operating problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
