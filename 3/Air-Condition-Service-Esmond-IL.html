<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule however got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

Secondly, there must not be any challenges en route of the airflow that may avoid it from covering the area of the properties as much as possible. The outside system must likewise be found in an open area, otherwise the heat from the house will not be effectively released outdoors and the productivity of the entire system will drop sharply.
