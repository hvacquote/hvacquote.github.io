<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor.

Prior to that takes place, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
<p>A 3rd way to choose whether your house may have poor indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, look for indications of issues with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can indicate your house may not have adequate ventilation include moisture condensation on walls or windows, foul-smelling or stuffy air, filthy central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other items become musty. To discover odors in your home, action outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether odors are noticeable.<p>
<p>Sometimes a short-lived indoor air quality issue is produced just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded meeting area. In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more complex concerns-- identified by regularly inappropriate air quality tracking results-- will need a different tack. Depending upon the concern you're experiencing, among the three methods below may be suitable.<p>
