<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
