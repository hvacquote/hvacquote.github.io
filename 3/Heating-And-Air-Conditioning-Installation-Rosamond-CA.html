<p>Trane central air conditioning conditioners are understood for maintaining guarantees and offers a standard 10-year guarantee that covers both parts and labor. A Trane XR14 that has a 14 SEER ranking in energy effectiveness would cost anywhere from $4,800 to $6,800 to install.

<p>After the system has actually been looked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside must be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
