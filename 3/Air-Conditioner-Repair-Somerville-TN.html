<p>Volatile organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals emitted as gases from products or processes; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a brand-new carpet is likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in enough outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
