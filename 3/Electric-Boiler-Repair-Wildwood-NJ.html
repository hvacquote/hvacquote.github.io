<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more tough to manage than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or listed below 65%.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
