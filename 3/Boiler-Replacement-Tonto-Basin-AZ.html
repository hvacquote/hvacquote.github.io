<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product in time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
