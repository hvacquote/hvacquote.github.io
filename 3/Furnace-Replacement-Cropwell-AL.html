<p>Great Item! Shipment was type of weird being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was very lite weight and requires time to apply. Keep in mind: buy advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we fixed problems. I would recommend this item to anybody who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
<p>If your a/c unit is old, consider buying an energy-efficient model.
