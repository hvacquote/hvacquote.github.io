<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that wetness needs to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting mold buildup, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a uncomplicated and effective  method to reduce ambient air contamination and possible health risks, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>I am very satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years back and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
