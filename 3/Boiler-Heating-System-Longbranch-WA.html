<p>Appropriate ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air toxins are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same contaminants. Simply put, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>I have been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a difficult task that the workers sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.
