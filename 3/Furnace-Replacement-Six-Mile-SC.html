<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, select your contractor sensibly, many of the 'reliable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a trusted company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same).
