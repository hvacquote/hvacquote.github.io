<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
