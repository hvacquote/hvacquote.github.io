<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
