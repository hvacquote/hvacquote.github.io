<p>Central air is a high-end not everybody can pay for, many Seattleites need to discover methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in big box shops like Best Buy, package fans and window AC units are snatched up as soon as they're stacked in floor displays. Seattle may be the last city in the country to deal with the truth of a terrible, terrible summer.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
