<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted frequently, and outside measurements used for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements.
