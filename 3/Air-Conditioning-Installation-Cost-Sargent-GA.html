<p>Sean was really valuable. He is a very enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns other than the blower motor.
