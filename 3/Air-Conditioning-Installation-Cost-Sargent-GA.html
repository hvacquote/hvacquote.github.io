<p>Sean was really valuable. He is a very enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns other than the blower motor. The only reason he could not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
