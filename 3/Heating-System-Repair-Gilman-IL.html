<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the very same. Once the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately cure and solidify-- normally two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
