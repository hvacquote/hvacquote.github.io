<p>I typically do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>

<p>Nick B. provided remarkable, individualized, attentive, and quality service. His communication style gets along, efficient and engaging. He clearly and thoroughly described all problems and repairs in a way that made me positive in his capability to resolve my repair issues. He followed through and went above and beyond to personally pick up a required part that was not in stock, ensuring repairs were made so that my partner and I would not need to endure another night without heat, throughout among the coldest winter seasons in recent memory. He also responded to my call right away the next morning, and coached me through a short-lived fix to a problem that could not be resolved on the first visit due to unavailable parts. I trust Nick's skills, experience and capability to provide consistent, quality service.<p>
