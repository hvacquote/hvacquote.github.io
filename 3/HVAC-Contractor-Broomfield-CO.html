<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
