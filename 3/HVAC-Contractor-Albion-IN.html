Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>Before cooling or setting up any brand-new heating system in a home, it is required to re lower the energy and examine load of the house. A more energy efficient house will not only minimize the cost of a brand-new system and energy expenses, however it will significantly improve the comfort of your house. Before we style and install any systems, we schedule a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will recommend improvements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these improvements. Basic improvements normally include adding insulation and air sealing steps.
