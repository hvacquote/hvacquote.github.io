<p>The compressor can overheat and shut down if the condenser coils are blocked. You'll experience intermittent durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are clean, clean them again. Turn off the power. Turn the air conditioning service and furnace circuit breakers in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the detach block (Picture 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Image 2). If the a/c service still does not work effectively after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>With the cost of electrical energy and gas increasing, it is essential to have your furnace tuned-up for optimum energy cost savings. This will keep you from unnecessarily paying more than you should. Apotheosis Heating & Home Comfort Solutions Combustion Optimization & Safety Inspection of your furnace includes an Efficiency Check-Up, in which the thermostat is looked for accuracy and the burners are adjusted for optimal effectiveness. Apotheosis Heating & Home Comfort Solutions DOES NOT utilize the ineffective 'eyeball the flame' approach that other companies utilize. Instead, the combustion is enhanced by measuring the exhaust gasses and making clinical changes. This alone could spend for the entire maintenance see at today's price of natural gas.<p>
<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
