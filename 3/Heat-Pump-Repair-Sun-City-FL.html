<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
