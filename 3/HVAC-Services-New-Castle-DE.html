<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature level of the flooring. All wiring for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>Immediate impacts might appear after a single direct exposure or duplicated direct exposures. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant impacts are generally short-term and treatable.
