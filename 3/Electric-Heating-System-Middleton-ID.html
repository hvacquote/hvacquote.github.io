<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should temporarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
