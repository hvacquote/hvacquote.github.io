Integrity isn't just their name, it's a service model they take seriously. You people are officially on speed dial. Talk with you quickly.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ might see musty or unpleasant odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are getting worse, speak with your physician about them. But not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for good structure management.<p>

Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you find you have to do it regularly, it's probably time for an expert viewpoint.<p>
