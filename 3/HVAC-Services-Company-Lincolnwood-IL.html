<p>The properties and structure of the soil in an area can impact the rate at which heat is conducted through the ground. These need to be considered before choosing the best style of an underground heating and cooling system. Soil with positive heat transfer homes needs fewer pipelines to attain the desired underground cooling and heating impact, while those with reduced thermal conductivity will require more pipes.<p>
<p>Great service within 24 hr and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was extremely thorough and on-time in discussing what services would be performed. Also Camryn provided terrific customer care at the end of the appointment by discussing exactly what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of suggestions of some maintenance tasks we might wish to have performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics used by some in the market.<p>
