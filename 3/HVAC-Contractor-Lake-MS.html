<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the cooling separately for each space. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
