<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a reference in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4).

The female crimp connectors ought to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
