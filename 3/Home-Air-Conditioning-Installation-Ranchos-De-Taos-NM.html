<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
