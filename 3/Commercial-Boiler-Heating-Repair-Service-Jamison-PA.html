<p>Last week, Target told press reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the preliminary intrusion into its systems was traced back to network qualifications that were stolen from a 3rd party vendor. Sources now inform KrebsOnSecurity that the supplier in question was a heating, refrigeration and air  conditioning subcontractor that has actually worked at a number of areas at Target and other top retailers.<p>
<p>Geographically, some areas pay consistently higher earnings for air conditioning tradespersons. This might be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable environment, or simply a high level of competitors for skilled trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's greatest average salaries for HVAC specialists at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 annually. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 annually. Massachusetts and Connecticut completed the five highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 per year.<p>

This must do the trick up until you buy a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
