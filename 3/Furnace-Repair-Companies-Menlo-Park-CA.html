<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Menlo Park CA Home Owners</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>

<p>The likelihood of immediate responses to indoor air pollutants depends upon a number of aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two essential influences. In other cases, whether an individual reacts to a contaminant depends on private sensitivity, which differs enormously from person to person. Some people can become sensitized to biological toxins after duplicated exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical contaminants also.<p>
<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a circulation system. Metal pipelines are hardly ever used due to long-lasting corrosive concerns. Essentially all hydronic radiant flooring heat systems today use 1/2 inch size plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is extremely flexible, will not rust and is available in long lengths, which enable PEX pipe to be woven with very little or no joints.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless poisonous gas. Due to the fact that it is impossible to see, taste or smell, CO can eliminate you prior to you are aware it is in your house. At lower levels of exposure, CO triggers mild impacts that are often mistaken for the flu. These signs include headaches, dizziness, nausea, disorientation and fatigue. The impacts of CO exposure can vary considerably from individual to individual depending upon age, general health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
