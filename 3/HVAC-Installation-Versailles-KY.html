<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
