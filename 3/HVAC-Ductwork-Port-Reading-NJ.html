<p>Resideo uses a range of energy-efficient Whole-House Ventilation System solutions for both brand-new building and construction and retrofit applications. Breathing air contaminants can cause allergic and asthmatic responses, infections and other health issue that involve the lungs, nose and throat.

<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a big central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outside your home. Heatpump operate on electrical energy and work like air conditioners in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.
