<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
