<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that only a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, however a property owner does not have the tools or abilities essential to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and correct air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, however house owners lack the needed devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still essential to have a specialist technician inspect the system regularly.<p>
<p>Generally the most reliable method to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate specific sources of pollution or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more affordable method to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later in this area.<p>
