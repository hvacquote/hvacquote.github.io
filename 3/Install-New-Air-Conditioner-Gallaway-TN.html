<p>I am really amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years back and understand the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The objective is to supply enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A common component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
