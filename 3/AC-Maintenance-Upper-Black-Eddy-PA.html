<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you ought to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
