<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
