For instance, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperatures (design levels), rather of the greater temperatures often utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for most of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to supply thermal comfort indoors.

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each room to be changed individually. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heatpump While space air conditioning supplies maximum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more pricey than central air.<p>
