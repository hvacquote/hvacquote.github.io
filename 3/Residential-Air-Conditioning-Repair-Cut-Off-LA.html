<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
