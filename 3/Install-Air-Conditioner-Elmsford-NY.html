<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
