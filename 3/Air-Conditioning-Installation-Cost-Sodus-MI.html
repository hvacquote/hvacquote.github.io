<p>I usually do not leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>

<p>The primary health impact connected with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
