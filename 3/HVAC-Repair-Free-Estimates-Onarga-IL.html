<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else could come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they needed to buy it. My wife said that she had seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most good individuals I have actually met in a very long time. We require to support the real individuals who are there for us if we want to have options to ACME heating. Please do.<p>
