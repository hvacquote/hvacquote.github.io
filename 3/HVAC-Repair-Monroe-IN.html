<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool spaces down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate due to the fact that it simply takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit. And an oversize system does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The outcome is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
