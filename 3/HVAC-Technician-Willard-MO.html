<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have built-in hold-up features. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've registered for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The very best feature of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers guarantee would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they identified the concern and fixed extremely rapidly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine parts. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs dealt with by professionals, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
