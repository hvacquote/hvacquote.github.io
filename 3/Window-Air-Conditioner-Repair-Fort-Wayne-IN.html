<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future.

Follow the instructions above under Air conditioning system Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's handbook.<p>
