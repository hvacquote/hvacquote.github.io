<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. The likelihood of immediate responses to indoor air toxins depends on a number of aspects including age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether an individual reacts to a contaminant depends on individual sensitivity, which varies tremendously from individual to person. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological or chemical pollutants after duplicated or high level exposures.<p>
