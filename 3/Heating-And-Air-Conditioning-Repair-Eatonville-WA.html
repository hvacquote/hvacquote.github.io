<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his employees, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the objective of owning a company was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to construct business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't completion goal. HVAC company owner should pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the very same in all other areas.<p>
