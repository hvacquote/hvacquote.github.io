<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
