<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do decline them up until they have actually been properly dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent gos to.<p>
