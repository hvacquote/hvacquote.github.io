The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
