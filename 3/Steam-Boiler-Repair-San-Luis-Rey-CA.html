During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, many of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item.

<p>I confess I haven't done the math recently, however I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular examinations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio where the system sits. I seem like they give me favoritism, and want to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>
