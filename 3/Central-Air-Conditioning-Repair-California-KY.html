It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outdoors air.<p>

<p>Geothermal heatpump are exceptionally efficient, since ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is always at a constant temperature level. These systems can obtain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only achieve an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Just like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of performance (COP). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system removes or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling effect. A lot of ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for every unit of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, roughly 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>

<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation several years back and know the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
