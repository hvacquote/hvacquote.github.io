<h3>Vertical Air Conditioner in Marcellus Michigan</h3>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
