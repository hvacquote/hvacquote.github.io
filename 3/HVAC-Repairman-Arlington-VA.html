<h3>Factors to Consider When Searching for a Fantastic AC Repair Company in Arlington VA</h3>
<p>Most people understand that outdoor air pollution can impact their health, however indoor air contamination can also have considerable, harmful result. EPA research studies of human exposure to air toxins suggest that indoor levels of contaminants might be 2 to five times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- higher than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board regularly rank indoor air contamination among the leading five environmental health dangers to the general public.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Make sure all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The minimized air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
