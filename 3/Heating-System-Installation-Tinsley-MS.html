<p>All houses need reliable ventilation. The quality of indoor air inside workplaces, schools, and other workplaces is important not just for workers' convenience but also for their health. Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has actually been connected to symptoms like headaches, fatigue, trouble concentrating, and irritation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Also, some specific illness have been connected to particular air impurities or indoor environments, like asthma with damp indoor environments.

Ventilation removes unpleasant smells and excessive moisture, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior structure air flowing, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
