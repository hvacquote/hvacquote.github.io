<p>Another technique to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your house is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming inside your home.

Local bathroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of impurities directly from the room where the fan is located and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly reduces direct exposure to toxins throughout cooking. Incorrect modification, frequently indicated by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, causes increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame suggestion is blue. If you purchase a new gas range or variety, think about buying one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot burner that burns constantly. Never use a gas range to heat your house. When the fireplace is in use, always make specific the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
