<p>Indoor impurities. These include chemicals utilized in the construction or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these home appliances (cook ranges, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops should be used with fans that send out exhaust exterior. Gas-fired heating home appliances must be sealed and power-vented systems installed to get rid of products of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also develop particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>

Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside must be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
