<h3>Things to Search for When Hiring an Dyke VA HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>The icing problem ends up being a lot more serious with lower outside temperature levels, so heat pumps are typically set up in tandem with a more standard type of heating, such as an electrical heater, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heat pump throughout harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Oil heaters tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be appropriately vented and cleaned up from the furnace frequently. Modification the filters periodically and have your ductwork cleaned up due to the fact that the soot builds up inside the ducts, reducing their performance with time. Anticipate to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
