After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

Simply put, in-floor heating systems provide a various mode and level of convenience. And, as numerous public awareness campaigns have long reminded us, the more comfortable we feel, the more inclined we might be to push down our thermostat, in turn reducing our energy expenses.<p>
