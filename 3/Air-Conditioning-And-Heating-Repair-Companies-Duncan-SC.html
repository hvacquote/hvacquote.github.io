<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical.

<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Duncan SC</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will require to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
