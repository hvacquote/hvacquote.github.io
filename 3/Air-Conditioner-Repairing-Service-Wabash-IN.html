<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, since it is secured indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to install.

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that ideal temperature level throughout the year.
