<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either since of visible development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Leaky return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>In a packaged central air conditioner, the compressor, evaporator, and condenser are all located in one cabinet, which generally is put on a roofing or on a concrete piece next to the house's structure.
