<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up frequently, they can end up being blocked with debris that can limit airflow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's efficiency. Filthy filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down entirely. By comparison, examining and replacing a furnace filter can generally be carried out in just a few minutes, frequently without any tools needed.
