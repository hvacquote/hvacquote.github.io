<h3>Tips for Fast Furnace Repair in Rock Falls IL</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very delighted that someone as skilled as Adam had the ability to return and fix the air conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance plan, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to test the air conditioning system before you purchase. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to test AC units even in winter season. We wish we had known him then.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
