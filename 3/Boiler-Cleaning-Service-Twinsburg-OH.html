<p>Some biological contaminants trigger allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some kinds of asthma. Infectious illnesses, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are sent through the air. Molds and mildews release disease-causing contaminants. Symptoms of health issue caused by biological contaminants consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, sleepiness, fever, and digestive issues.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is frequently crucial to determining the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such details can often be acquired by requesting copies of air monitoring data from the company. If monitoring data is not offered, yet a high variety of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent must request that the company have air tracking tests performed. Evaluation of this information may identify potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are extremely low, monitoring information might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
