<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
