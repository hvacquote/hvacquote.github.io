<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit, think about possible impacts of indoor air pollution. Follow the maker's directions, specifically directions on the proper fuel and keeping the heating unit properly changed.

While a space heating system is in use, open a door from the room where the heater lies to the remainder of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
