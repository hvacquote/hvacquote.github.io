<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  unit instead of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year turned off the electrical energy open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
