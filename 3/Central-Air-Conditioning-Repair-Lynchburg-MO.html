<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Lynchburg MO</h3>
<p>Numerous Canadian jurisdictions do not have specific legislation that deals with indoor air quality problems. In the absence of such legislation, the "basic task provision" applies. This provision, common to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, mentions that an employer needs to offer a healthy and safe office. Thus, ensuring the air is of excellent quality is the company's task.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
