<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing.

If we do choose to use car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
