This type of air conditioning unit also is utilized in small commercial buildings. Air supply and return ducts originate from indoors through the home's exterior wall or roofing system to get in touch with the packaged ac system, which is normally situated outdoors. Packaged air conditioners typically consist of electric heating coils or a gas furnace. This mix of air conditioning system and central heater removes the requirement for a separate furnace inside.<p>
