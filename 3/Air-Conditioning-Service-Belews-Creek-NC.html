<p>Structures are created or meant to react actively to some of these changes in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean up, sanitize, and keep surface areas to boost their efficiency, appearance, or longevity. In other cases, such modifications discreetly and even dramatically change structures in manner ins which might be necessary to their own integrity or their effect on structure occupants through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that specify them at any time. We may discover it beneficial to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, specifically, a few of the techniques utilized by scientists studying communities, in order to gain an improved understanding of the environments in which we invest most of our time, our buildings.<p>

<p>If your single phase a/c isn't old enough to justify replacement, think about an entire house dehumidifier. By setting up dehumidification equipment inside an existing single stage system, you can enjoy some of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without changing any devices. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, improving indoor air quality and allowing higher comfort at higher temperature levels.<p>
<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product gradually. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
