However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
