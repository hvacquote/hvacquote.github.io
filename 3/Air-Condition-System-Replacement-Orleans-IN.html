<h3>How Do Air Heat Pump Works in Orleans IN?</h3>
<p>When building your new house a well-functioning Heating and Cooling system is essential, in addition to the air quality you breathe inside. We have the experience and resources needed to help from the preparation phases through to the last installation. We use the most recent software to assist design your ductwork system and use the greatest quality materials in the building and construction and installation.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
