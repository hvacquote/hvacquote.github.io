<h3>Locating Greatest HVAC Contractors in Ann Arbor MI</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current pattern in home building is to lower air leakage through fractures and other openings in walls, floors, and roofings. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them.. Secondly like prolonged car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to effectively service and the system has actually been running issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
