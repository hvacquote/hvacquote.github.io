<h3>Truth All Homeowners Should Know About HVAC Installation in Kintnersville PA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by improving airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
