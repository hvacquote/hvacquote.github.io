<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not provide auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to provide automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There must not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
