<p>Another pollutant of indoor air is outdoor air.

As a society, we make sure that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, but we do not think adequate about direct exposure to all the things we position in our houses," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.

Throughout high usage months, check the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
