<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside unit as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work.

<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems in Rockville VA</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heater need relatively little attention. But, just like any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is important to keep the system functioning efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system resemble those of conventional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank need to be looked for leakages, the system must be flushed periodically to remove tank and collected impurities (scaling in difficult water locations). The systems must be inspected at least two times annually for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be washed regularly to get rid of dust collected in order to enhance collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
