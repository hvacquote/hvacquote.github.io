<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either since of visible development or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
