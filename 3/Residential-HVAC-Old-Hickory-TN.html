<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the air conditioner back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging material to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>Reality: Federal and local rewards normally amount to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can typically make the initial price of a system competitive with conventional equipment.

Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. However, new installation practices are minimizing expenses, to the point where the price is getting closer to conventional systems under the best conditions.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
