<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>The fuel lines that supply gas to your furnace must also be inspected routinely. Dripping gas and fuel can be a fire threat. Detached fuel lines can jeopardize the performance of the HVAC system also. Soot can collect in burners and split heat exchanger s can have an influence on the system's efficiency also. The maintenance. service technicians will assess all of these aspects of the furnace and carefully and eliminate all blockages and traces of soot.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and disconnect block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait for the AC to begin (see Be Client at Startup," below). The compressor must run and the condenser fan must spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor begins but the fan doesn't. Turn off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Reinstall the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan starts. If  it doesn't, you've given it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
