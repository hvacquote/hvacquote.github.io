Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the space temperature level, and after that change it ON. To prevent straining an a/c's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
