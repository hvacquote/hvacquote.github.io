<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
