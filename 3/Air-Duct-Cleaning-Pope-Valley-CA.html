<p>You won't have to suffer the Florida heat for long when you give Scott's One Hour Air Conditioning & Heating a call. Our emergency services will come to your aid if your air conditioner stops working during the night. You can reach us every day of the year, vacations and weekends included. A functioning cooling system is important to your health and convenience. We're offered at all hours to make sure that your system remains that method.<p>
<p>We suggest using our insulation boards when installing over concrete pieces. When utilized in combination with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely efficient thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile rather of allowing heat to warm up the concrete slab listed below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business many years earlier and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
