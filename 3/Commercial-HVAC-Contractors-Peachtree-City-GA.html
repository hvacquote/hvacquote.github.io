<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
