<p>Air toxins can vary from contaminants generated from the outdoors by your family pets to dangerous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a typical air contaminant resulting from gas that gets away into your home without being burned off. Older homes may consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In restrooms and kitchens, mold and mildew can end up being a nuisance where wetness levels are usually higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless harmful gas. Because it is impossible to see, smell or taste, CO can eliminate you before you are aware it remains in your house. At lower levels of exposure, CO causes moderate results that are typically incorrect for the influenza. These signs include headaches, lightheadedness, disorientation, tiredness and nausea. The effects of CO direct exposure can vary greatly from individual to individual depending on age, overall health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
