<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems in Bradenton FL</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heater. We chose getting something more costly than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our biggest energy costs. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
