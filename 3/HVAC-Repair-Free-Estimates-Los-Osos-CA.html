<h3>Things to Consider When Buying a Heat Pump in Los Osos CA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "tough part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
