<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area.

Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage.
