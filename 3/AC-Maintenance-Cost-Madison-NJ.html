<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Madison NJ</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on various house efficiency upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took sufficient time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost reliable, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the largest cost savings. We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's services and products was outstanding. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to perform the necessary electrical enhancements to save on cost.<p>
<p>Examine these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the lowered air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the problem.<p>
