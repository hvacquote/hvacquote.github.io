<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to assist keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your house at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your house.

Other factors that can affect this could be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a large central air conditioner unit that sits outside your home. Heatpump operate on electricity and work like air conditioning system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
