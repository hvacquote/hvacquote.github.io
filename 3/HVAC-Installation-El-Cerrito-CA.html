<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 ought to be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more difficult to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is typically important to figuring out the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such information can in some cases be gotten by requesting copies of air tracking data from the employer. If monitoring information is not readily available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union agent ought to request that the company have air monitoring tests performed. Evaluation of this information might determine possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when pollutant concentrations are very low, keeping track of information may not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
