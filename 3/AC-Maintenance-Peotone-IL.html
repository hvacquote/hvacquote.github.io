<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Peotone IL - Reasons Why You Would Need to Reset The Boiler</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his inspection, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it really rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
