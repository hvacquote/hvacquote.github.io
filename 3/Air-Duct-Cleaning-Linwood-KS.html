The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power must not surpass the capability of the outside system.

Put simply, the outside system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that some of the spaces might not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the overall power is not basic, because it takes into account not just the small power of the units, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
