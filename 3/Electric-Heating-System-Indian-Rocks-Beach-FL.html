<p>A third way to choose whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, look for indications of problems with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can suggest your home may not have adequate ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, smelly or stuffy air, filthy central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other items end up being musty. To spot odors in your home, step outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether odors are obvious.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in adequate outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
