<p>Streamline your services, make more services revenue, and provide an incredible customer experience. To ensure the unit you select is the right size for your home, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load calculation estimate to identify the exact type of heat and air conditioning system that's perfect for your home-we do not simply replace it with the exact same size unit you presently have. These computations think about things such as the size of your house, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is vital so the system isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>

The very best central air conditioner you can buy today will utilize 30-50% less energy than one purchased in 1975 while providing the very same amount of cooling.<p>
