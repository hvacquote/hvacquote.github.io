<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air.

Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 ought to be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements used for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might also be necessary.<p>
