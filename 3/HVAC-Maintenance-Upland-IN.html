<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
