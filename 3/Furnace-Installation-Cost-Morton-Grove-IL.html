<p>Particular instant effects are similar to those from colds or other viral illness, so it is often hard to figure out if the signs are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is very important to pay attention to the time and place the symptoms happen. If the signs fade or go away when an individual is away from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort needs to be made to recognize indoor air sources that might be possible causes.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
