<h3>Water Heater Thermostat in Elgin TX</h3>
<p>We contacted Elite A/C on one of the most popular days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out very same day to examine situation & chose to choose them for the work. I am happy to state that not only did we get the central air going but also replaced the heating system which was old. Everybody we spoke with from beginning to end were very professional, courteous and the work was very effectively done. I would extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>A lot of well and city water does not normally contain lead. Water typically gets lead inside the house from home pipes that is made with lead products.

Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for additional information.<p>
