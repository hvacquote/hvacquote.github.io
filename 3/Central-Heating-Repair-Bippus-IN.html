<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, a lot of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
