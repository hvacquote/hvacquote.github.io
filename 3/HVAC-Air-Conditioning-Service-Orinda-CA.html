<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to find an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Do not put the condenser under a deck or totally confine it because it exhausts warm air out the top. Any airflow restriction will lower the unit's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best feature of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Likewise they identified the issue and fixed extremely rapidly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
