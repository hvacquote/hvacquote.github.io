<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis.

This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
