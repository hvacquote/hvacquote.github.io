<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of common air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Image 6).<p>
