Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Photo 6).<p>

<p>To set up a safe assessment or visit with an HVAC technician throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, start by comparing service technicians in your location in an online search. Message or call professionals to ask whether they can perform a consultation over the phone and even over a video call. In this manner, they can evaluate the problem without increasing the threat of infection transmission by visiting your home.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to preserve the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor sensibly, much of the 'respectable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales strategies that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a trusted company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>We understand that pipes and HVAC emergencies take place at the most troublesome times. That's why we offer emergency services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
