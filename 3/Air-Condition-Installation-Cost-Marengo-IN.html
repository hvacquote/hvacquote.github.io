<h3>Three Crucial Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Marengo IN</h3>
<p>The remainder of the HVAC system also requires to be in top condition for the air conditioner to work well. This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which live inside the home. If the private parts remain in proper order, the technician can analyze the ductwork for signs of holes, gaps or excessive dirt. Sealing leakages in ductwork can enhance HVAC performance by as much as 30 percent, and provide for a cooler home in the hot summer season.<p>
<p>Because an a/c moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept tidy. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise essential to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
