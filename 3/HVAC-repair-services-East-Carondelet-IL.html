When you opt for Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you won't need to fret about a thing.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor unit as near to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
