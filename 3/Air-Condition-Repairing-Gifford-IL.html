<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the see. They suggested replacing a few parts that were going out.

I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part.
