<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
