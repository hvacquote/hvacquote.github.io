<p>Routine maintenance keeps a furnace working effectively, according to HVAC professionals like Dave Mejean of B&W Plumbing & Heating in Indianapolis.

<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as developed. Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to enhance the operation to save energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperature levels sometimes used to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to provide thermal comfort indoors. However, high humidity outdoors develops the need for careful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities generate mold development and wetness inside your home is connected with a greater occurrence of occupant respiratory problems.<p>
<p>Outside contaminants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a house, outdoor particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates. Experts advise using filters with a MERV 6-8, however higher MERV levels trap smaller particles and normally are better for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>
