<p>As a skilled HVAC expert, we advise you have your systems examined and routine maintenance performed two times per year, when in the Spring (before cooling season) and when in the Fall (before heating season).

<p>In most cases, if materials have actually failed to dry out a number of days after the thought water event, mold development is suspected within wall cavities even if it is not instantly noticeable. Through a mold investigation, which may consist of damaging inspection, one should be able to determine the existence or lack of mold. In a scenario where there is visible mold and the indoor air quality might have been compromised, mold removal might be required. Mold testing and examinations need to be carried out by an independent investigator to prevent any conflict of interest and to insure precise results; totally free mold testing used by remediation companies is not suggested.<p>
