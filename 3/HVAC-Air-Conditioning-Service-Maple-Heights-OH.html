<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly positioned or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which might go into neighboring ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor water fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
