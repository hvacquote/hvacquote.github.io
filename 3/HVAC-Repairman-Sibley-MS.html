<p>Another approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the quantity of outside air coming inside your home. Many home heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of pollutants directly from the space where the fan lies and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
