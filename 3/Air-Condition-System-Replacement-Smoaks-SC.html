Heat pumps work on electrical power and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top, don't place the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it. Any air flow limitation will lower the unit's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>
<p>The installation was quick, professional and very well done. The installers were respectful and understood precisely what to do. I am an engineer by profession and acknowledge easily people who are good at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are very good and do not miss out on detail that creates a task effectively done. I very extremely advise the 2 gentlemen as they are excellent at what they do. Thank you to them as they certainly deserve my thanks and gratitude for a task well done.<p>
<p>Allergens are products that cause an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can end up being airborne, and therefore, are easily breathed in. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the presence of cat allergen might cause an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergic reactions, but not in those individuals who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Depending on where in the US your home lies, the local area's climate can alter significantly.
