<h3>Furnace Installation in Champlin MN</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The best aspect of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers guarantee would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they detected the problem and fixed very quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>There are a few main points that property owners will wish to take into account when choosing which of the best AC units they ought to set up in their houses. It really depends upon what you value the most in a top brand central air conditioner. The significant aspects for the majority of homeowners will be the total cost to set up the very best a/c brands, life-span of the AC system, service warranties offered, energy efficiency (SEER rankings), and size of the unit you need for your home's square footage (TONS) to efficiently cool your home.<p>
<p>Many companies use third party warranty companies - not YORK. YORK items are backed by some of the best minimal service warranties in the business, consisting of YORK's factory-backed service warranty. Due to the fact that these warranties lead the HVAC industry in covering parts and essential mechanical elements, you can rest assured knowing you've selected the best furnace and ac system for your house or service.<p>
