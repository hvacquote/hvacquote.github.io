<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
