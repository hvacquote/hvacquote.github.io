<p>I confess I haven't done the math recently, but I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they offer me preferential treatment, and want to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>
