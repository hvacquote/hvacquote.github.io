<p>House owners might likewise assume that because a glowing flooring heating system can be seen (and financed) as a home improvement, its installation will immediately raise their house's worth. No proof exists suggesting that in-floor heating either favorably or negatively impacts home values.

<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Long Beach CA</h3>

No matter what the type of house HVAC system, sufficient air flow (ventilation), correct filtering, and humidity control all add to a healthy indoor air environment. > Likewise, frequent maintenance of the HVAC system will guarantee that it is running securely and not contributing to or triggering an indoor air issue.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
