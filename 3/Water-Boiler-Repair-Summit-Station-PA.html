<p>I am very pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business many years earlier and understand the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by individuals and animals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these impurities through the home.<p>
