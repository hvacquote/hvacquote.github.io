<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heating systems, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>

This means that cost savings are still understood during the cooler duration. In fact, a desuperheater reduces winter season water heating expenses by approximately half.<p>
