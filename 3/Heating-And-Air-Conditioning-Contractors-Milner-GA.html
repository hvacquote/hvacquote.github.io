<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that might impact the health of people who reside in the home. Contaminants might come from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon getting in the house from the ground listed below. An air contaminant could also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, unstable natural substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or personal care products. Viruses and bacteria, animal dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Some biological pollutants trigger allergies, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma. Transmittable illnesses, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Molds and mildews release disease-causing toxins. Symptoms of health problems triggered by biological pollutants include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, sleepiness, fever, and digestion problems.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which leads to the supply and elimination of air from inside a building." Those processes consist of bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the building, and moving some part of indoor air outside. The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
