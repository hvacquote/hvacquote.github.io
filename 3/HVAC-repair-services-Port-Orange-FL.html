<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical product over time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
