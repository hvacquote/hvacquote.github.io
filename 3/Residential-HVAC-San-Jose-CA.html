<h3>Things to Know Before Becoming a HVAC Contractor at San Jose CA</h3>
<p>For whole house setups, it's tough, if almost impossible, to retrofit a radiant heat system in an existing house, especially a hydronic system. Localized glowing flooring heat systems to be used in one or numerous rooms like restrooms, kitchen areas or laundry rooms are quickly remodelled with electric radiant floor heat. This is a lot more economical on a smaller scale. Larger renovations like additions to a house may be suitable for a larger scale and more expensive hydronic system.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
