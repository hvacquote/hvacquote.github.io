<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>More common in relatively older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes gas, electrical power or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in private rooms.

More recent gas boilers should achieve 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers must accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
