<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be extreme. They consist of delays in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Infants, fetuses, and children are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than adults given that lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the damaging results of lead. Kids may have greater direct exposures given that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
