<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for ac system repair, which you must watch out for. First, you should check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
