The female crimp adapters should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
