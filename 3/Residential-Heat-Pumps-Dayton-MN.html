<p>EHSI's indoor air quality group masters including a multidisciplinary technique to indoor air quality (IAQ) obstacles.

Initially, use exterior-grade pushed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, cabinetry, and wall surface areas. Or, as an alternative, consider using strong wood products. Second of all, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make certain that a reliable wetness barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet. Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated if it becomes wet.<p>
