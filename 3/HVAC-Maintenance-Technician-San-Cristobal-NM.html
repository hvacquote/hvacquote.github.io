<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at risk. EPA estimates that exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and seriousness of symptoms in hundreds of countless asthmatic children, and may trigger countless nonasth-matic kids to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition worsened by exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to secondhand smoke causes nose, eye, and throat inflammation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have linked direct exposure to secondhand smoke with the beginning of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ DETAILS), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ might observe undesirable or moldy smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are worsening, speak to your physician about them. But not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for great structure management.<p>
