The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>Both the condenser and the evaporator are sealed. For that reason, a professional service person ought to be required almost any maintenance besides routine cleaning.
