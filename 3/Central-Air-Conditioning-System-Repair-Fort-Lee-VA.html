<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
