What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>

Dripping refrigerant can damage your vehicle's evaporator and compressor. Getting an automobile ac system service at the first sign of problem will save you both cash and time.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
