I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering early degeneration, causing holes and cracks. , if that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and secures the component.. a really useful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
