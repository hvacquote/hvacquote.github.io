<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on different house performance upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took sufficient time to help us debate which upgrades were cost efficient, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest savings. We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's services and products was impressive. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to perform the needed electrical improvements to save money on cost.<p>
