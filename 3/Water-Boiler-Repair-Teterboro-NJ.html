My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Iâ $ m actually particular with my things. I like my equipment and appliances original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with low-cost knock-offs. So purchasing this air conditioning unit to replace my old one was somewhat of a challenging reality. You canâ $ t trust the commercial nowadays. Because it has restored my faith in great production, am glad I got this however. I havenâ $ t had a problem with this new Provider I got since I bought it 7 months back. Itâ $ s simply perfect.<p>
