<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>

Infectious illnesses, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Mildews and molds release disease-causing toxic substances.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine components. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, see Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
