<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical product in time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
