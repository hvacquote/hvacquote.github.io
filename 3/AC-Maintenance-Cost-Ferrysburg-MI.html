If you have actually installed the parts shown and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
