<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in.

<p>The predominant health impact connected with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
