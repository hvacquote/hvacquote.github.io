<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating devices can last for years. But if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel costs all of a sudden appear greater than regular, it is probably time to think about a new system. New heating equipment is much more efficient-- you'll see lower fuel expenses right now, not to discuss the cash you'll save money on repair costs. If your heating unit is 25 years old or more, you can most likely expect to cut your fuel bills in half.<p>

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they utilize air to exchange heat, in the same way as an automobile radiator or common household a/c unit does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outdoors air.<p>
