<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your home that perfect temperature level throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those common air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
