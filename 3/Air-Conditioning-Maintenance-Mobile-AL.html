<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

<p>Nearly half of Americans use air fresheners at least once a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that often, our nationally representative study found. Roughly 40 percent seldom or never ever clean their humidifier or cooking area variety hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have never cleaned up or replaced their furnace filter. And nearly 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>
