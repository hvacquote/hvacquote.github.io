The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, but it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
