They weren't inexpensive but a fast web search validated WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was extremely pleased they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will absolutely be using them once again.<p>
