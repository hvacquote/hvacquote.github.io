<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
