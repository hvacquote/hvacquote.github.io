<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
