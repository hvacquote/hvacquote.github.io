<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as vital as a routine oil modification in your vehicle.

Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and particles in the air. When every 3 months, Energy Star advises changing your filter. Throughout high use months, check the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
