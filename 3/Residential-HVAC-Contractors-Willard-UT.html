<p>Lead has actually long been recognized as a damaging environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " number one environmental hazard to the health of children in the United States." There are lots of ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, weakening paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was known how harmful lead could be, it was used in paint, gas, pipes, and many other products.<p>
