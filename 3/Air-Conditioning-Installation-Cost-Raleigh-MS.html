<p>All houses require effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from use. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adjusting to the right temperature level. Heaters that kick on frequently may be because of an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>
