To eliminate this, they have an usually plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area.
