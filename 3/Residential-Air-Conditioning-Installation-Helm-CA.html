<p>Before you go out and purchase an air conditioning unit, there are a couple of things to choose initially. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioning unit?

For example, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing premature wear and tear, leading to holes and cracks.
