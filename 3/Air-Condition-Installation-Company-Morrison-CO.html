<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, instead of commercial or outdoor settings. In jobs where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It might also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to individual areas.<p>

<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists if no contaminant sources are discovered. Extreme re-circulation of air results in "stagnant air" conditions.

When ventilation is not sufficient to account for an increase in the number of workers in the area, stagnant air might also be an issue.<p>
<p>Benzene is a recognized human carcinogen. The main indoor sources of this chemical are environmental tobacco smoke, stored fuels and paint supplies, and automobile emissions in attached garages.
