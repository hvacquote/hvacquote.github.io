<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
