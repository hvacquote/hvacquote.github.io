<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
