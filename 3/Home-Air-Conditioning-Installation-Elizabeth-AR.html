<p>If you think a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
