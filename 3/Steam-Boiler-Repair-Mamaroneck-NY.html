<h3>HVAC Systems Are a Must for All Homes and Offices in Mamaroneck NY</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
