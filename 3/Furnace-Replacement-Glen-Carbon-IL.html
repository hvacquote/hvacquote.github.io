<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Make sure all the registers in the house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
