<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't offer off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place over time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to work up until you buy a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
