<p>I generally don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
