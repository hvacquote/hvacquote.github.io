<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items include vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. These items present a danger just when they are managed in such a way that creates dust including asbestos fibers which can be inhaled. When asbestos-containing products are damaged or interrupted by repair, redesigning, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can end up being airborne if proper controls are not in place. This can lead to the capacity for substantial health issue.<p>
