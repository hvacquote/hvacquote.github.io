Some sources, such as developing materials, furnishings and products like air fresheners, can release toxins basically continuously.

<p>The very first air conditioners and fridges utilized poisonous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to deadly accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
