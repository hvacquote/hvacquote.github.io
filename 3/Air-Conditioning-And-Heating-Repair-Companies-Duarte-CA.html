<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
