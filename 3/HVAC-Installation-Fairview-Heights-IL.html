<h3>How To Pick An HVAC Company at Fairview Heights IL</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
