<p>A packaged system, normally set up on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial structures, however it is also an option for house owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those wanting to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, considering that the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are usually only available for bigger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a great way to save cash on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best option for house owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
