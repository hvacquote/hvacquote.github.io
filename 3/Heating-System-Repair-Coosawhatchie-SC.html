<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was really handy in collecting information on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to briefly deal with the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and offered clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
