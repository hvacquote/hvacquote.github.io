<h3>Signs You May Need an AC Repair Service at Union Springs NY</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by enhancing airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
