<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. Once the electrical wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively treat and harden-- generally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
