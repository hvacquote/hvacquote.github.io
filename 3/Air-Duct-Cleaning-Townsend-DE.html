If your air conditioner is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leakages, simply adding refrigerant is not a solution. A trained technician ought to fix any leakage, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the right amount of refrigerant. Keep in mind that the efficiency and performance of your a/c unit is biggest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the maker's spec, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be harmful to the environment.<p>

Because an unit is installed in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy.
