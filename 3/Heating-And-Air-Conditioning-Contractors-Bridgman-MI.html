<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
