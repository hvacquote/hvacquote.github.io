More major than many allergenic homes is the capability of mold to set off episodes personallies that already have asthma, a major breathing illness.<p>
<p>Great Item! Shipment was sort of weird being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all intact. The product was incredibly lite weight and requires time to apply. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we fixed problems. I would advise this item to anybody who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
