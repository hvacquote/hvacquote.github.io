<h3>Heat Pump Prices in Lena Mississippi</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and effectively, but to have 2 significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>I have had the satisfaction of dealing with Pro-Staff Mechanical, Inc. for nearly ten years and during that time, they have constantly supplied excellent service. Every person I have handled is friendly and professional. The techs are timely, effective and polite. They aim to finish every task as rapidly as possible and understand our budgetary requirements on all five of the commercial homes on which I assist with the management.<p>
<p>Overall, they tend to need less energy than other type of heating, and they're relatively comfortable, not striking you with an unexpected rise of heat. They tend to cost about $6,000 to install in the typical house. Since numerous air-source heatpump have trouble working in extremely cold temperature levels, they're best matched for temperate climates, and will generally require an alternate backup heating system.<p>
