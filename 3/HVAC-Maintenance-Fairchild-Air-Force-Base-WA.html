<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Your air, ventilation, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a variety of impurities that have the potential to adversely impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungi, germs, and extremely small particles of dust.

<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance and Tune-Ups in Fairchild Air Force Base Washington</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the property.<p>

<p>I had a dreadful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company used 98% of the existing material acquired with your house. This company presented a service arrangement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and pipes. During the inspection on a really cold day they eliminated the furnace declaring health risk reason and contractor laws for their choice.
