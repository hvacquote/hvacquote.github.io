<h3>Air Condition Installation Near Me in Lithia Springs GA</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
