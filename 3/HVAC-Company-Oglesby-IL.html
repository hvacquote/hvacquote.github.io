<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my companies, my own houses and my real estate clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with different rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again, he helped me problem shoot the concern. He is sincere, trustworthy, and affordable on rate. It's hard to find a sincere AC person and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
