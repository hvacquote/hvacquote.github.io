<p>Many Midtown Houston Tx clients do not understand why their HVAC system is not working when they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair request. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you require to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you remain in luck, that's probably your issue. If you found that your conditioning filter requires replacing, then the next action is to thaw your air conditioning devices. The most convenient method to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
