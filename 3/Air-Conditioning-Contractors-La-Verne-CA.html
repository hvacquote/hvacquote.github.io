<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in monthly, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
