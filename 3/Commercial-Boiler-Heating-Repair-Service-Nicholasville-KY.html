<p>Before you go out and purchase an a/c, there are a couple of things to decide first. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioning system? If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How large should the ac system be? Too big and you'll encounter issues with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c unit and shorten its life. Too little and your a/c will not have the ability to cool the house properly. When going shopping for a new AC system, these are just a few of the aspects that you require to take into account. Each option can and will significantly impact your system's performance, which is why you can't afford to overlook any of them.<p>

<p>The primary health result associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
