<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control may contravene efforts to try to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the greater temperatures in some cases used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for most of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to provide thermal convenience inside. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors creates the need for mindful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities give rise to mold development and moisture indoors is connected with a greater occurrence of occupant respiratory issues.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
