<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a recommendation later). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
