<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Through typical usage and the system's presence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioner might end up being extremely filthy.
