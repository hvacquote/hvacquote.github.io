<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do decline them up until they have actually been correctly dried. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot.

Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
