An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing prior to work began.

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
