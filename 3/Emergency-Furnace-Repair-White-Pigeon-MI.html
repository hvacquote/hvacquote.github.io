<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and people; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can end up being airborne.
