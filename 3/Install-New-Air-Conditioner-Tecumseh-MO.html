<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not provide them.. Secondly like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to appropriately service and the system has actually been operating issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
