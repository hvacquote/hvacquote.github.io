<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the visit. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost however a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was extremely delighted they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be using them again.<p>
<p>Whatever heater you set up, it's necessary that it's sized correctly for your house. Too large and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should.
