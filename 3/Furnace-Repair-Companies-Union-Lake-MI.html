If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good idea of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil.

The simplest method to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
