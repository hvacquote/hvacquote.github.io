<h3>Is Your Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Lakeside MI?</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing trend in home building is to minimize air leakage through cracks and other openings in walls, floorings, and roofing systems. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings.
