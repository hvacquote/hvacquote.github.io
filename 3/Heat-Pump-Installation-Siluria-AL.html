Manufacturers generally continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts readily available and honoring maintenance contracts after the new standard goes into result.<p>
<p>More common in reasonably older homes, a boiler-based heating system uses gas, oil or electricity to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in specific rooms.
