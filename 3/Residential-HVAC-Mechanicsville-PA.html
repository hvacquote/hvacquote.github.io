It does not depend on heating or moving air to move warmth.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not use them.. Secondly like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found somebody to appropriately service and the unit has actually been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
