<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
