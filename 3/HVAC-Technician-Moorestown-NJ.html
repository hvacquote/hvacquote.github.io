<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation expenses. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfy. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned frequently, they can become clogged with debris that can limit air flow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's efficiency. Dirty filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down entirely. By comparison, checking and replacing a furnace filter can typically be carried out in just a few minutes, frequently without any tools required. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
