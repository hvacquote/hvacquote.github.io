<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Items HVAC Repairin Prince George VA</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or washed as conditions require. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

Clogs can obstruct the circulation of condensed water and cause moisture build-up within the system. Excess wetness can trigger problems like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the property, unequal temperature policy, germs, and jeopardized air quality. An expert maintenance technician will clean up the condensate and flush drain to make sure all excess wetness streams away from the system.<p>
