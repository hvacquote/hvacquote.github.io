<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Items HVAC Repairin Prince George VA</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or washed as conditions require. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

Clogs can obstruct the circulation of condensed water and cause moisture build-up within the system. Excess wetness can trigger problems like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the property, unequal temperature policy, germs, and jeopardized air quality.
