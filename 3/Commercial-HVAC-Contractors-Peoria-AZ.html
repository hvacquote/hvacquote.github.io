<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, considering that some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
