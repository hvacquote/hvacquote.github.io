<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most heating systems have several control boards. The biggest, or only one in some heaters, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control board must be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t appropriately diagnosed, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable as soon as set up. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a professional to identify.<p>
