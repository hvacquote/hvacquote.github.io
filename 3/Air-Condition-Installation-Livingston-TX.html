<p>At present, EPA does not recommend using air cleaners to minimize levels of radon and its decay products.

EPA's booklet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, offers more information on air-cleaning gadgets to lower indoor air toxins.<p>

<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge pollutants.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items consist of vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. These products provide a threat only when they are dealt with in such a way that creates dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be inhaled. When asbestos-containing materials are harmed or disrupted by repair, remodeling, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can end up being airborne if appropriate controls are not in location. This can lead to the potential for significant illness.<p>
