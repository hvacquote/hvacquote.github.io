<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
