More often than not they were initially interested in remotely monitoring some other element of their buildings, such as energy use, in an effort to cut costs. It wasn't until later, as they continued working with us, that they found out about and executed indoor air quality monitoring to offer a healthier, more secure structure environment-- and to head off the negative repercussions related to indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Re-install the access panel and detach block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait for the AC to start (see Be Patient at Start-up," listed below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan need to spin. If the compressor begins however the fan does not, the fan motor is more than likely shot. Shut off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Re-install the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan begins. If  it doesn't, you've offered it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
