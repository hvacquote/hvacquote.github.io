<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the check out. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was extremely delighted they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will certainly be utilizing them again.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it could grovel two times the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would use. That's since it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to offer a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling bills than devices set up just a few years ago.<p>
<p>We have been incredibly happy with Integrity's equipment (Trane dealer) and service (today Braxten completed yearly maintenance of our system). Trane heat pump has worked effectively and is so efficient that it significantly lowered our utility expenses - the system will spend for itself in less than 5 years. The few times we require them for emergencies they responded quickly and resolved the issue.<p>
