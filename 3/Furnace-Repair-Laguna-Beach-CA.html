<h3>Heater Repair in Laguna Beach CA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule however got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
