<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in delay functions when they're shut down and after that repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually subscribed to an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature listed below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
