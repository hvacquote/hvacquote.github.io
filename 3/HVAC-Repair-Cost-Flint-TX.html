<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled.
