<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate fantastic however Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service agreement attempts to upsell you whenever they concern perform regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400?
