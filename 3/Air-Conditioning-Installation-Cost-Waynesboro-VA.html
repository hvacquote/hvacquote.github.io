The temperature of the air produced by the heatpump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel really hot. Only be worried if your home is not warming up. Nevertheless, if your system does not appear to be working appropriately, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice.

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling occupants. Unlike other types of ac system, evaporative coolers count on the outside air to be transported through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its air duct system; this cooled outside air must be enabled to push the warmer air within your home out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and preserve.<p>
