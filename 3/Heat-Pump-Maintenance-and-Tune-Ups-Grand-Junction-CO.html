<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you ought to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
