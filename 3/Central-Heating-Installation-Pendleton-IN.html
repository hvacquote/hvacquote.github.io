<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a reference in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
