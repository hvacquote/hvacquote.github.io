<h3>The Way to Maintain Healthy Ductwork To Get A Healthy Home in Petersburg MI</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating unit. We chose getting something more expensive than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our most significant energy expenditures. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a tube twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electrical energy open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
