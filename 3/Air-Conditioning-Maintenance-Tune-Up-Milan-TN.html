<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. When the circuitry is total, energize the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats.
