<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for consultation and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<h3>Truth All Homeowners Should Know About HVAC Installation in Foley MN</h3>
<p>Another technique to reducing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside. A lot of home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening windows and doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate impurities directly from the space where the fan is located and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>

<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California.
