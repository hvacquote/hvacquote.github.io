<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they give me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
