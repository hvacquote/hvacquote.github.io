<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.

Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 ought to be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be essential.<p>

Other aspects such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can likewise impact how individuals respond to the indoor environment.<p>
