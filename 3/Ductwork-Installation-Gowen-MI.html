<p>A/c can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
