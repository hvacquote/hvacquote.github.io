Initially, you ought to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.
