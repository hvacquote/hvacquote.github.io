<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c unit works but your house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
