<p>Right now, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold might be residing in your home's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe along with the effectiveness of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current survey by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. But much of the things individuals do-- or don't do-- can contribute to the stew of airborne pollutants in their houses and aggravate asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Add To Air Quality Issues. HVAC systems can also worsen indoor air quality issues. The HVAC system might be contaminated (since of mold in duct lining or bacteria on coil or filters, for example), and the system might spread these contaminants throughout the house. Second, the HVAC duct circulation system can spread out toxins from one part of the house to another. Regular maintenance and duct sealing can help decrease these problems.<p>

<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Bethalto IL</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating unit. We selected getting something more costly than a traditional hot water heater as gas is among our greatest utility expenditures. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
