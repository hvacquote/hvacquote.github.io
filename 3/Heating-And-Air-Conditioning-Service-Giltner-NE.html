<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from usage. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the correct temperature. Heating systems that kick on often might be because of a filthy filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>

As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
