<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current pattern in home construction is to lower air leakage through cracks and other openings in floors, walls, and roofing systems. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to an increase in indoor air issues.

The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
