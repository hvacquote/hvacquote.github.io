<p>Iâ $ m truly picky with my things. I like my equipment and home appliances initial, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with low-cost knock-offs. So purchasing this a/c to change my old one was somewhat of a difficult fact. You canâ $ t trust the commercial nowadays. Due to the fact that it has restored my faith in great manufacturing, am glad I got this though. I havenâ $ t had an issue with this new Carrier I got because I bought it 7 months earlier. Itâ $ s just best.<p>
