<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my businesses, my own houses and my real estate customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again, he helped me problem shoot the issue. He is truthful, reputable, and sensible on rate. It's difficult to discover a truthful AC person and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ may observe moldy or unpleasant odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for great structure management.<p>
