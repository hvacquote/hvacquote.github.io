<p>The predominant health impact associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
