<p>Check these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in your house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the problem.<p>

<h3>Gas Heating in Villa Grove IL</h3>

When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
