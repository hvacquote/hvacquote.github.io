<p>I am really impressed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business many years ago and know the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service contract attempts to upsell you whenever they come to carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, even though it was 6 months prior to the current one expired. She didn't need a air filtration system, however they talked her into it.<p>
