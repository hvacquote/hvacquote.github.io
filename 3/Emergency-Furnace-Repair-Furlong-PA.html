<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>It's on days like these that the idea of an in-floor heater seems less like a luxury product and more like a need. (Besides, heated up floorings were excellent enough for the Roman Empire) But before you dedicate to what can be a major improvement project, it's finest to ask yourself whether a radiant floor heating system is a suitable option for your particular home heating needs.<p>
