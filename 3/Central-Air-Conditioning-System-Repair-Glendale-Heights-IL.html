<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to offer adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A typical component required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
