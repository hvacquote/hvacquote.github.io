<h3>Portable Air Conditioner in Fanwood New Jersey</h3>

The unit runs silently and efficiently, however to have 2 significant elements stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by warranty.
