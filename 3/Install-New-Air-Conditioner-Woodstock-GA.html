<p>The pollutants noted in this guide have been shown to cause the health impacts discussed.

<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ may discover unpleasant or musty smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems.
