<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was essential and renovated the whole plenum and the duct for the hot water heater due to the fact that the specialists believed they just didn't appear right and they couldn't leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
