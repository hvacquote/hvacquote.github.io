<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor unit as near to the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
