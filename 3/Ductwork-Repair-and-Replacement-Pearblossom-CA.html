<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer malfunctions, your Nest will not begin. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that protect your cooling system from flooding. One of the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent chance; you may have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency security switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate spoil on rare occasions.<p>
