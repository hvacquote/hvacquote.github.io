<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you might want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capabilities. If you currently have a house heating system, you might look for a heatpump more tailored towards cooling capacity and efficiency. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to search for a model that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one significant downside of heat pumps is that they can fail in the cold or incredibly hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
<p>The primary health impact connected with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your risk of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
