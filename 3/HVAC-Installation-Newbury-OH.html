<p>These men have actually been terrific. At a real estate agent, I often require contractors to provide me an opinion for what work on a house might cost. Just recently I needed to get in touch with these men twice. They came out rapidly and gave me a no nonsense quote for the work.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing.

Hope this helps.<p>
