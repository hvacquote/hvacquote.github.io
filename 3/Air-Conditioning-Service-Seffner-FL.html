<p>When trying to figure out how often I must change my air conditioning filters, there are many things to take into factor to consider.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
