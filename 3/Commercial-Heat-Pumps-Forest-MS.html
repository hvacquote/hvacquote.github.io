<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you should examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
