They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
