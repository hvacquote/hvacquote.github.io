<h3>Discontinue Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water at Jamestown VA</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or changing air in any space to provide high indoor air quality which involves temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation removes undesirable smells and extreme wetness, presents outdoors air, keeps interior structure air circulating, and prevents stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
