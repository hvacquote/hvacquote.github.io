<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in every month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
