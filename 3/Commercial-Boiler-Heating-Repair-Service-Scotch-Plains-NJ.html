<p>A packaged unit, typically installed on the roofing, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, but it is likewise an alternative for property owners to consider. Many times, these units include not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those seeking to save money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system individually, because the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are generally just available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a great way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best option for property owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
