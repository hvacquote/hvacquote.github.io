<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are extremely rare now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>

You'll wish to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take control of when temperature levels reach freezing. If temperatures reach and drop below freezing, your heating technician can set up controls which immediately shut down the heat pump. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, effectively heating the house in these conditions.<p>

Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be fatal).
