<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Allergens are materials that cause an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can become airborne, and hence, are easily inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you consider a group of people with asthma, the presence of cat allergen could induce an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergies, but not in those individuals who do not have feline allergies.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, frequently described as central air conditioning" or split-system air conditioning", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, walls, or floors covered by grills) carry cooled air from the ac system to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Find out how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
