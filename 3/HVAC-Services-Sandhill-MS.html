<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All items in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature level after the radiant heat system has been operating for a while, consisting of individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

Air-side economizers also use outside air to condition areas, however do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and distribute cool outdoor air when appropriate.<p>
