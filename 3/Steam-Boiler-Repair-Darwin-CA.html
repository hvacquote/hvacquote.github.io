<p>The icing problem becomes much more severe with lower outdoor temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more traditional type of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heatpump throughout harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the traditional heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
