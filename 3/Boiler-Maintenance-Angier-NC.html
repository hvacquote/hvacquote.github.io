<p>. Prior to picking the installation location of air conditioning unit, several main elements require to be considered. First off, the direction of air flow from the indoor units must not fall on the place of rest or workspace. Secondly, there need to not be any challenges on the way of the air flow that might prevent it from covering the area of the facilities as much as possible. The outside unit must likewise be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be successfully released outdoors and the performance of the entire system will drop sharply.

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product with time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
