<p>We contacted Elite A/C on one of the most popular days of summertime( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to evaluate scenario & decided to opt for them for the work. I more than happy to state that not only did we get the central air conditioning going but likewise changed the heating unit which was old. Everyone we spoke to from beginning to end were very professional, polite and the work was very efficiently done. I would highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Employ professionals and treat them well: Encouraged, well-compensated experts carry out better work than short-term subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success.
