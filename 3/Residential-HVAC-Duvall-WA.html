<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable materials, ceiling, wall, and flooring coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 48 hours may become a source for mold development and need to be disposed of. Sometimes there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can grow in concealed or hardly ever accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Repair the wetness problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the area using established health department recommendations.<p>
