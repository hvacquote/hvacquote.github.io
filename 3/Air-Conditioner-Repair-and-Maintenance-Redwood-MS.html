<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
