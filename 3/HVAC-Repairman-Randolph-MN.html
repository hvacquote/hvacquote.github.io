<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
