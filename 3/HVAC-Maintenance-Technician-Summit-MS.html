<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with routine preventive maintenance, however, there will constantly be the odd issue that sometimes shows up. When you do discover your furnace behaving strangely, it is extremely crucial that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible.

<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the primary problem. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more troubles, given that some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>
<h3>Central Air Conditioning Repair in Summit Mississippi</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
