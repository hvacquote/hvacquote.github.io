Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
