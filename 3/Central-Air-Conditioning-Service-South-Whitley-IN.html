<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace professionals often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up routinely, they can become clogged with debris that can restrict air flow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's efficiency. Unclean filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down entirely. By comparison, changing a furnace and examining filter can generally be done in simply a couple of minutes, frequently with no tools needed. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
