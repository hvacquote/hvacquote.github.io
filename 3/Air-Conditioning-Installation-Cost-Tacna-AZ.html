<p>Even if you do not feel filthy, pollen clings to your hair and clothes where it can easily irritate your nose and eyes, and contribute to indoor air pollution. Don't have time for a quick rinse?

<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, specifically if the objective of owning an organisation was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't completion goal. HVAC company owner should pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the same in all other areas.<p>
