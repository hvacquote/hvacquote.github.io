<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. Since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless unit has a built-in performance benefit. Since they do not require any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Because an unit is set up in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
