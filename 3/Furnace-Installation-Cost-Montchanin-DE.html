<h3>Central Heating Repair in Montchanin Delaware</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and effectively, but to have 2 significant parts stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature, and then switch it ON.

<p>I am very pleased with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business many years ago and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
