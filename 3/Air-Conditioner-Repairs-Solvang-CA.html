<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned frequently, they can become blocked with debris that can restrict air flow, potentially affecting your convenience and your system's efficiency. Unclean filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down completely. By contrast, examining and replacing a furnace filter can normally be done in just a few minutes, typically with no tools required. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
