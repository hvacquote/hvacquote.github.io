<h3>Knowing the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Cary NC</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the math recently, but I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine assessments. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits. I seem like they give me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>Since an air conditioning unit moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both need to be kept tidy. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
