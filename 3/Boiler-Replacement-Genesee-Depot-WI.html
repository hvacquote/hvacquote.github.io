<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were preferred in the first half of the 20th century, specifically in commercial buildings, apartment and large residences. Many steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago remain operable, due to the fact that the absence of moving parts makes them less prone to wear and tear.
