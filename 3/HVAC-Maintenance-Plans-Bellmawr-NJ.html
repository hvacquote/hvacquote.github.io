<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the ac system boost. This increase has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. For that reason, an expert service person should be required practically any maintenance aside from routine cleaning.

While there aren't many repairs you can make yourself, there are specific maintenance treatments you can follow to keep your system running at peak effectiveness.<p>
