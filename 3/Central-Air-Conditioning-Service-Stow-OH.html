<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have integrated hold-up features. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air toxins depends on several factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two crucial influences. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a pollutant depends on individual sensitivity, which differs enormously from person to individual. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological pollutants after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical contaminants too.<p>
<p>PE companies tend to run with the objective of selling or spinning off a company eventually. This could be through a public offering, a sale to a big service in the field, or even a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management. Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, earlier this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for three years prior to that.<p>
