Changed to using Wachoff's about a year earlier and they've been to your home for a system tune-up three times now. They're priced reasonably, have handled the one repair I required well, and are constantly on-time and expert. Have actually been through a few companies throughout the years and Wachoff's is definitely the best I have actually had the opportunity to deal with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has been fantastic.<p>

Not only was the price fantastic however Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

Improper adjustment, often indicated by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. If you purchase a new gas stove or range, think about buying one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot burner that burns continuously. Never ever utilize a gas stove to heat your home. Always ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in usage.<p>
