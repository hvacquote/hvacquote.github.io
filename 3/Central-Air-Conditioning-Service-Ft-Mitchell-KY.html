<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Ft Mitchell KY</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Furthermore, extremely dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>When mounting a wall sensor, think about the height at which they need to be positioned.

For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the highest concentrations inside structures are generally near the ceiling. Alternatively, ozone is much heavier than air and remains near the flooring.<p>
