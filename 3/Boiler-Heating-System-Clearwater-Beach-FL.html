<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps in Clearwater Beach FL</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely useful. He is a very enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure applied to buy extra things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no problems other than the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't provide them.. Secondly like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required skills to do the job and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to properly service and the system has been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
