<p>I am replacing our High Speed System since of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Provider, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including three (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have a choice for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Provider Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the exact same. As soon as the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively cure and solidify-- generally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside must be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
