Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do decline them up until they have been appropriately dried. If goods with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
