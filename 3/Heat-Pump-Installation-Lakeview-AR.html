<p>A packaged system, typically set up on the roofing, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, but it is also an option for property owners to consider. Many times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those seeking to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, considering that the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are typically just available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to save cash on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than buying simply a cooling system.
