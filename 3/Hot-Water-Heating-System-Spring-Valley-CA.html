Transmittable health problems, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are sent through the air. Mildews and molds release disease-causing toxic substances.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs managed by specialists, see Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
