<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As a first step, in April RMI affirmed before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor guidelines based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor appliances through codes, and after stronger standards are set there is a chance to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide need to be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>

To discover odors in your house, action outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your house, note whether odors are noticeable.<p>
