Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage.

<p>Central air units are determined in loads. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.

Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide must be adjusted often, and outside measurements utilized for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>
