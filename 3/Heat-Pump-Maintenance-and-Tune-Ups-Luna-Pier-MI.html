He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company several years earlier and understand the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year.
