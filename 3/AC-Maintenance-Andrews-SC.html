<h3>Furnace Repair Near Me in Andrews South Carolina</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>Another option to oil furnaces are gas furnaces While oil is typically used in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have a choice between the two types.

<h3>Electric Furnace in Andrews SC</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
