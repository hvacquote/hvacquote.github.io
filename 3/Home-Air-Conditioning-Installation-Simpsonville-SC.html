<h3>How Do Air Heat Pump Works at Simpsonville SC?</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even small window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. In addition, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
