<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew just what the problem was and fixed it really quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<h3>AC Technician in Rockfield IN</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me concerning an unusually high costs that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of concern. Ron had identified the difficulty area in examining the costs. He solved the issue in one day, had actually changed the costs to what I thought about fair before he called back, understood what might have caused the problem and had a plan to guarantee that it would not take place once again. I have actually considered All Points a company with stability for the nine years we have actually used them. This experience validates that.<p>

<p>Often a short-lived indoor air quality issue is created just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded conference area. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more intricate problems-- recognized by consistently unacceptable air quality tracking results-- will need a various tack. Depending on the concern you're experiencing, among the 3 methods below might be suitable.<p>
