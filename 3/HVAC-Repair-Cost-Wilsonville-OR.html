These treatments range from sophisticated tracer gas methods used mainly in constructing research efforts to less involved procedures that can be used by constructing operators.

<p>A/c can likewise be offered by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
