<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like extended automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to properly service and the system has actually been operating issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
