<p>If you set it too low, you're encouraging the growth of mold in wet air. The heat dries out the air, preventing mold development and contamination. Of course, too-dry air can also irritate your lungs and sinuses, while too much indoor humidity can add to the development of germs and infections, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a home is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>

<p>Next, and perhaps simply as important when it pertains to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too big will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to properly cool the house on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
<p>By piping coolant directly into the smaller sized wall-mounted units, ductless splits allow you to avoid the need for a full duct system like a lot of other cooling systems require. You will likewise enjoy a a lot more flexible system in regards to installation and cost. And since each indoor unit has its own thermostat, you can bid farewell to thermostat warfare when one person would prefer it a little warmer in a various space.<p>
