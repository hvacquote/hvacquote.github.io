<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your home will not warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A filthy filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

Residential units can even more improve indoor air quality by regular cleaning of carpets and rug.<p>

Even if the opening is small, air will move till the inside pressure is equal to the exterior.<p>

<p>There's a big difference between the heat transfer of radiation and the other typical form of home heating-- convection.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at specific risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
