<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden flooring joist system, beneath the wooded subsurface and last flooring surface. This is normally utilized in a third-floor or second area and makes the most of the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional thickness of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber radiant floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipes to direct heat upward.<p>
