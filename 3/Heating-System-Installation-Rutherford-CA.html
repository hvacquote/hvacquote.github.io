<h3>Baseboard Heaters in Rutherford CA</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
