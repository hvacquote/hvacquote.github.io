<h3>The Way Central Heating Boilers Keep Your Hopewell VA Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even small window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or washed as conditions require. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
