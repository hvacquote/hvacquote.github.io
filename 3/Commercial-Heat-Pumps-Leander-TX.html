<p>Today, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building particles, and mold might be residing in your home's duct, impacting the air you breathe in addition to the effectiveness of your heating and a/c system. There are several design methods in usage today; however, all ground source heat pumps operate with comparable concepts. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop in between the surface area units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These various heat sources also determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>
