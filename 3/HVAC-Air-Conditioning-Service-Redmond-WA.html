<p>The very first thing that you will in fact need to install will be the air handler, which will be available in your central heating system installation package.

That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps guys working. When a sales guy comes to your house he exists to offer, that is the only method he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and must not "require" to offer you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I provide you the choices for your requirements and you choose if you need it.<p>
