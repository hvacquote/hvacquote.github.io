<p>Specialist heating system installations. However, even the best-maintained heating system will eventually stop working. HVAC specialists recommend following this standard rule when deciding whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the price of a brand-new system, it's finest to purchase new.
