<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment producer's to ensure your factory warranties remain in location. Additionally, the tangible results of a PM is typically difficult to quantify, as one action specified the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioner don't just break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the result of repetitive use of a part that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail too soon since the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing premature wear and tear, resulting in fractures and holes. If that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the component.  a really helpful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
