Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
