<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner in Maidens VA</h3>
<p>Your lungs are accountable for bringing fresh air into your body, while all at once getting rid of waste gases and particulates. Needless to say, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the harder it is for your lungs to eliminate them. Poor air quality - whether it is inside or outdoors - can make it progressively tough for your lungs to operate effectively, and can have unfavorable health affects.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
