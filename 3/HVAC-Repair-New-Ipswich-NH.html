<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c boost. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
