<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All objects in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the radiant heat system has been operating for a while, consisting of people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace begins and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off.<p>

<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it could suck up to twice the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would use.

Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed simply a few years back.<p>
<p>Gas furnaces do feature some disadvantages. The biggest disadvantage is also the result of the combustion procedure.
