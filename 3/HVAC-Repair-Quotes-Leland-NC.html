<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
