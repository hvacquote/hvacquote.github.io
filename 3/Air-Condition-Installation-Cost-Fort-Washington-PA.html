<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment producer's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in location.

Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit do not just break at the breeze of a finger, but rather is the result of recurring use of a part that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might fail too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing early degeneration, resulting in fractures and holes. , if that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and secures the part.. a very useful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
