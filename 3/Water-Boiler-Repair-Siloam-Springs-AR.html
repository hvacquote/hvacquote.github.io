<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While installing a separate split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more troubles, because some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each space.
