They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
