Technicians are often required to operate in cramped locations, on high ladders near ceilings, or on the roofings of homes. They can be exposed to undesirable weather for extended periods of time.

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
