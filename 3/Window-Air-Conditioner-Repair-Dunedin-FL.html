<p>Central air systems are determined in heaps. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it means the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>The contaminants listed in this guide have been shown to trigger the health results discussed. Nevertheless, it is not always true that the effects kept in mind happen at the pollutant concentration levels normally discovered in the home.

<p>The primary health impact related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
