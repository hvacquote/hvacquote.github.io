Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
