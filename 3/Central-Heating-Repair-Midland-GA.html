<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives requests for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. However, a lot of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item.
