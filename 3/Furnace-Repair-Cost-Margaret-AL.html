<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in.
