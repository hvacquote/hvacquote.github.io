Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their deal with a company that was working on the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they provide me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little bit more for that comfort.<p>
