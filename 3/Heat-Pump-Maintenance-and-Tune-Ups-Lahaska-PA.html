The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor pollutants and assists exhaust them from the house.<p>

<p>A/c can also be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage.
