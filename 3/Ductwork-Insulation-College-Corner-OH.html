<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, specifically if the objective of owning a company was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't the end objective. HVAC entrepreneur need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the exact same in all other areas.<p>
