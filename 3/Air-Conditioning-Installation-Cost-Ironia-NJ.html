<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace service technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up frequently, they can end up being blocked with debris that can restrict airflow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Unclean filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases cause the system to close down totally. By comparison, replacing a furnace and checking filter can typically be carried out in just a few minutes, frequently without any tools required. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
