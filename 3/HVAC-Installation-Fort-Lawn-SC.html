<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really take in no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
