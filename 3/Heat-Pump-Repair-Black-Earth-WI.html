The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and structure materials add to bad air quality, and can also cause cancers.
