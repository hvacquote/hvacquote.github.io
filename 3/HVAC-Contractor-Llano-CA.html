<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
