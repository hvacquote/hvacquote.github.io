<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
