<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should look out for. First, you ought to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
