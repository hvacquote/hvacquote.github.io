<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
