<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. In time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Prior to that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
<p>Air contaminants can vary from impurities generated from the outdoors by your animals to dangerous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a typical air contaminant arising from natural gas that gets away into your house without being burnt. Older homes may contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when released into the air. In cooking areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can become a nuisance where wetness levels are typically greater than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
