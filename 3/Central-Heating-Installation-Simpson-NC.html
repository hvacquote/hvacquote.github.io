My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
