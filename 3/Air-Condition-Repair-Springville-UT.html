<p>When our furnace was passing away, we got in touch with two local companies for quotes. While both were informative and handy, Ballard Gas provided us a better offer, for extraordinary service. Instead of an easy sales task, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heating unit and located ways we could have more even heat.
