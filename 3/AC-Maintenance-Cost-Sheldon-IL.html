<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
