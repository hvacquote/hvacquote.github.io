<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioner unit that sits outside your home. Heat pumps operate on electricity and work like ac system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This permits them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like an area heating unit) with the same quantity of electrical energy. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System in Fairburn GA</h3>
<p>Another technique to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your home is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming inside. Most home heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window ac system with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or cooking area fans that tire outdoors eliminate pollutants straight from the room where the fan lies and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
