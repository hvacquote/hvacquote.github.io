<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost great however Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

In this case, the control system is very vital to maintaining an appropriate temperature level.<p>
<p>1. Central Air Conditioning Source Heat Pumps Air source heat pumps work best in a moderate environment, where the temperature level doesn't get too low or too high.

The only genuine exception to this would be a geothermal heatpump system. However, a geothermal installation normally costs 10s of thousands more than an air source heat pump, which usually implies it fails in terms of roi.<p>
