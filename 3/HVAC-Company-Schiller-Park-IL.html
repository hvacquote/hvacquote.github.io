<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
