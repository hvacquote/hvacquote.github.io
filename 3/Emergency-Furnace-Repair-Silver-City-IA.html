<p>Indoor environments are extremely complex and building occupants may be exposed to a variety of pollutants (in the form of gases and particles) from workplace devices, cleaning products, building and construction activities, carpets and home furnishings, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building products, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), pests, and outdoor toxins. Other elements such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can likewise impact how individuals respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in enough outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
