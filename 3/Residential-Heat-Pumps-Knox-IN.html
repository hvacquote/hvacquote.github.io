<p>Regularly, indoor air quality problems in large commercial buildings can not be effectively identified or remedied without an extensive structure examination.

In many cases, these inquiries may quickly uncover the issue and on-site sees are unnecessary.<p>
<p>Lots of individuals are ending up being more aware and concerned about their health and the effect of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt consisting of toxins and irritants can cover the air conditioning ductwork with time.

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time.

In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
