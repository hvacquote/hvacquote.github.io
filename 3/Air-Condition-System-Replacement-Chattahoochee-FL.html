<p>How climate modification affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day ac system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system increase. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters houses through dirt floorings, fractures in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains pipes, and sumps. Direct exposure to radon ends up being an issue when radon becomes trapped in concentrations and structures construct up indoors.<p>

During usage, there is a time delay while heat is being transferred from the heating system to the home.<p>
