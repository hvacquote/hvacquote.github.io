<p>Examine these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your home are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>
