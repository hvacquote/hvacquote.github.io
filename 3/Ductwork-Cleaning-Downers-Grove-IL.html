The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most economical. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
