<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and children can be serious. They include delays in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Infants, children, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than adults since lead is more easily taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the harmful results of lead. Children may have higher direct exposures given that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

<p>The contaminants noted in this guide have been revealed to trigger the health effects mentioned.

In most cases, our understanding of the toxins and their health effects is too restricted to identify the levels at which the listed impacts might occur.<p>
<p>Typically the most reliable method to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions.
