<p>A customized air conditioning system that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard ac system in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air course. Because its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, since all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the same room, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is really heated up, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
