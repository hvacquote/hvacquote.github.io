<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
