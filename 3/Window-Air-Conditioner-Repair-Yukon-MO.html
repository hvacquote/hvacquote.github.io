<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00.

<h3>How To Avoid Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Yukon MO</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven. Screeching sounds from a belt-drive air handler normally take place when the belt that links the motor to the blower slips. In most cases, the belt is incorrectly lined up or worn and requires replacement. Follow the directions above under A/c Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's manual.<p>
