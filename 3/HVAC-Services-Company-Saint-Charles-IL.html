<p>Lots of family items release natural vapors that can cause negative health results. These results may include nose and throat inflammation, headaches, lightheadedness, and queasiness. Products consisting of these vapors consist of paints, strippers, fuels, solvents, pesticides, hobby materials, deodorizers, disinfectants, and cleaners.
