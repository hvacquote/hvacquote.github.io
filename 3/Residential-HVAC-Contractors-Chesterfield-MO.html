You can, nevertheless, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
<p>Indoor air pollution originates from a variety of sources; the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined building products, furnishings, and mold as severe issues, but much of the danger likewise comes from burning things.
