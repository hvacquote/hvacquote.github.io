<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO protect the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor sensibly, much of the 'reputable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a reliable company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Watch out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable materials, ceiling, floor, and wall coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to 2 days may become a source for mold development and need to be discarded. Sometimes there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can thrive in covert or rarely accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Fix the wetness issue, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely clean the location using recognized health department suggestions.<p>
