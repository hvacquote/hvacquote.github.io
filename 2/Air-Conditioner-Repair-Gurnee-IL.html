<h3>Home AC Repair in Gurnee Illinois</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>Another option to oil heaters are gas heating systems While oil is typically used in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have a choice between the two types. Gas heaters cost about the very same, approximately $6,000 for a high-efficiency unit. The genuine benefit of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your house. Heating with gas expenses around $540 a year, as opposed to the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a tough task that the employees sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps guys working. When a sales male pertains to your home he is there to offer, that is the only method he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and should not "require" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I provide you the options for your requirements and you decide if you require it.<p>
