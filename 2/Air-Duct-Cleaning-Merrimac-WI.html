<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c repair, which you should look out for. First, you need to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
