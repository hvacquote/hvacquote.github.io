If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are greater every year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be squandering money by not replacing the older unit.<p>

<p>As many of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment maker's to ensure your factory warranties stay in place.

Many pieces of a furnace or a/c unit don't simply break at the breeze of a finger, but rather is the outcome of repetitive usage of a component that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, leading to holes and fractures. If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the element.  an extremely helpful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a client thousands.<p>
