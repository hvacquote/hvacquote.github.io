A multi-split system 56 is a standard split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and enables cooling or heating of a number of spaces with one external system.

<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level.

When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
