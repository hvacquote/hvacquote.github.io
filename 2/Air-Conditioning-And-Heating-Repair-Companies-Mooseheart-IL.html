<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for assessment and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. The possibility of instant reactions to indoor air pollutants depends upon several aspects including age and preexisting medical conditions. In some cases, whether an individual responds to a contaminant depends upon individual sensitivity, which differs tremendously from individual to person. Some individuals can become sensitized to chemical or biological pollutants after duplicated or high level direct exposures.<p>

<h3>Emergency Furnace Repair in Mooseheart Illinois</h3>
<p>Toxins such as cooking smells, family pet dander, mold, cigarette smoke, and chemical doors might affect indoor air quality and hazardous health impacts might be created that can endanger locals. If members of your household are experiencing certain symptoms such as regular allergic reactions, cold or other breathing problems in your home, then it's time for these to be resolved and for your home's indoor air quality to be enhanced.<p>
<p>Some health impacts may appear shortly after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures to a pollutant. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediate impacts are treatable and usually short-term. Sometimes the treatment is just eliminating the person's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be identified. Not long after direct exposure to some indoor air contaminants, signs of some illness such as asthma may show up, be intensified or worsened.<p>
<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works however your house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
