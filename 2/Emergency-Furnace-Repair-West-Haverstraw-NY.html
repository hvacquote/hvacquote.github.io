In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system increase.

As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
