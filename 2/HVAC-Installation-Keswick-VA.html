<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
