<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the very same. Once the electrical wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly cure and solidify-- usually two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
