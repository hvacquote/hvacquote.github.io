Though only 33 percent of Seattle real estate units had air conditioning in 2015, more than 46,000 brand-new housing systems have been integrated in the four years because or are presently under construction.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
