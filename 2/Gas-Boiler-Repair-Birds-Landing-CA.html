Not only was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
