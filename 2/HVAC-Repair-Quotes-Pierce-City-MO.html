<p>It may feel comfortable being sealed in tight against the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, however for people who are delicate to indoor irritants or have breathing issues, winter can worsen problems.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The objective is to provide adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A typical component needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
