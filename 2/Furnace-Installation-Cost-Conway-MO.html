<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil.
