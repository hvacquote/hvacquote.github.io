<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system.

When the air conditioner works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
