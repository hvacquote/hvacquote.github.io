The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects toxins from indoor air (revealed as a percentage efficiency rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (revealed in cubic feet per minute). A very efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less efficient collector. The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends on keeping it according to the maker's instructions.<p>
