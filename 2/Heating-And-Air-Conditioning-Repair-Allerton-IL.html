<p>Learn More About PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects contaminants from indoor air (revealed as a percentage effectiveness rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (revealed in cubic feet per minute). A really efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon keeping it according to the manufacturer's directions.<p>

You get instant, real-time access to the tracking results via a control panel, which turns the data into visual charts that are simple to figure out.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
