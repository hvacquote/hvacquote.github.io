An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
