<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There must not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
