<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
