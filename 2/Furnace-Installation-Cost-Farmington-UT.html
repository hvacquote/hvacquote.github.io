Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>HVAC is a vital part of residential structures such as single family houses, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to big industrial and office complex such as medical facilities and skyscrapers, vehicles such as automobiles, trains, aircrafts, submarines and ships, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are regulated with respect to temperature and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ might see musty or unpleasant smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for excellent building management.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service agreement attempts to upsell you whenever they come to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for seven years, although it was 6 months prior to the existing one ended. She didn't need a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>
