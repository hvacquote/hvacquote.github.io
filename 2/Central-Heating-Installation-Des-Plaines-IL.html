<h3>Gas Heating in Des Plaines IL</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
