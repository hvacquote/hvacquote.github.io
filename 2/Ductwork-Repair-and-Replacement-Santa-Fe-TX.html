<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, instead of outside or commercial settings. In jobs where union subscription is not a problem, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the building. It might also include the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to specific areas.<p>
<p>The life expectancy of a central air system is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioners are more energy effective than designs made even 5 years earlier, so it makes monetary sense to change or upgrade your unit if it's 5 years old or older. The best central air conditioning conditioner you can buy today will utilize 30-50% less energy than one purchased in 1975 while providing the same quantity of cooling.<p>
