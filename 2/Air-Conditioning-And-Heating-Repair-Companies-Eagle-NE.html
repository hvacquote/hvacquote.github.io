<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and allows each room to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the a/c unit into a heatpump While space air conditioning offers maximum versatility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is normally more costly than central air.<p>
