<h3>Determining Heat Vacuum Cleaners in Wellford SC</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely happy that somebody as skilled as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had acquired the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c before you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to evaluate AC units even in winter season. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>

<p>I am very impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years earlier and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
