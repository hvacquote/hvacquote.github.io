The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their overall power must not surpass the capacity of the outside unit.

Nevertheless, the estimation of the overall power is not easy, considering that it considers not just the small power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
