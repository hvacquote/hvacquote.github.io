<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall.

In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, opportunities exist will be mold growing close by. Fix the moisture issue, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the area using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
