<h3>Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Repairing Wants in Mokena IL</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
