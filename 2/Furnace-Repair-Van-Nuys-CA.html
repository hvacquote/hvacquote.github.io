<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heaters were not working, integrity Energy was fast to react. They appeared the next day and replaced 2 heating systems and make them work.
