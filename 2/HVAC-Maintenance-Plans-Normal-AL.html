<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
