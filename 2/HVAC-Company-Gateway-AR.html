<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
