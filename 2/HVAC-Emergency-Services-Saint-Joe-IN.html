<p>EER means Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions.

The radiators may be mounted on walls or installed within the flooring to produce flooring heat.<p>
