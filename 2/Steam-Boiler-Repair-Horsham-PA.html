If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are greater every year, we know the system is not running effectively. It might be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective design, then you would be wasting cash by not replacing the older system.<p>

The heating and cooling will be inefficient and the indoor air quality will intensify. Examining and changing the air filters is one of the most crucial aspects of HVAC maintenance.<p>
