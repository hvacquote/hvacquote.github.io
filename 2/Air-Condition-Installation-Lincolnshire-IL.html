<p>If you need furnace operate in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else might come other than for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to order it. My spouse said that she had seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most good people I have satisfied in a long time.
