Such information can often be obtained by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the employer. If keeping track of information is not readily available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union representative need to request that the employer have air monitoring tests conducted. Evaluation of this information may recognize potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are extremely low, monitoring data might not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
