You can likewise inspect the filter to make certain it is clear of dirt and inspect the standing pilot light to ensure it is lit.<p>
<p>Since an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both should be kept clean. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise required to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
