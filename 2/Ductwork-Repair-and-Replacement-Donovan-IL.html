<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the same. When the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Do not put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly solidify and treat-- normally two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
