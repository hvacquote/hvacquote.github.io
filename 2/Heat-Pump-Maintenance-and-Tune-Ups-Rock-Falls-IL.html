<p>Specialist heating system installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating system will eventually fail. HVAC professionals recommend following this fundamental rule when choosing whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a new system, it's finest to buy brand-new.

If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
