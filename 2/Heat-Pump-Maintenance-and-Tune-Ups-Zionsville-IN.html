<p>Consumer items that contain methylene chloride include paint strippers, adhesive cleaners, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is known to cause cancer in animals. Also, methylene chloride is transformed to carbon monoxide in the body and can cause symptoms associated with direct exposure to carbon monoxide.

Use items that contain methylene chloride outdoors when possible; use inside your home just if the location is well ventilated.<p>

<p>Generally the most reliable method to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate private sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to decrease the quantity of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is also a more cost-effective technique to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later on in this section.<p>
<p>No matter what kind of heating system you have in your home, you can save money and increase your comfort by properly maintaining and upgrading your devices.
