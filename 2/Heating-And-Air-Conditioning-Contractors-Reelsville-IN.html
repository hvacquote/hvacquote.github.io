If several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the reduced air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
