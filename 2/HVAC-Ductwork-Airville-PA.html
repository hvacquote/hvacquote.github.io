The Department of Energy's Energy Effectiveness and Renewable Energy section recommends that "Air Purification need to have a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as identified by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are utilized to reduce the quantity of dust that reaches the wet coils. Dust can function as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can minimize the efficiency of the coils.<p>
<p>Old lead-based paint is the most considerable source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Harmful direct exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is poorly eliminated from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in homes can also result from lead dust from outdoor sources, consisting of infected soil tracked inside, and usage of lead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Decreasing pollutant concentration by utilizing cleaner (outside) air to dilute contaminated (indoor) air. Local building codes most likely specify the amount (and sometimes quality) of outside air that need to be continuously provided in your structures, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Briefly increasing ventilation coupled with proper use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be helpful in watering down the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
