<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the air conditioning unit back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s below package to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>
<p>A SEER ranking stands for Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio.

<p>Practically half of Americans use air fresheners at least when a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that often, our nationally representative survey discovered. Approximately 40 percent seldom or never clean their humidifier or kitchen range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have actually never ever cleaned or replaced their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>
