My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it really quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
