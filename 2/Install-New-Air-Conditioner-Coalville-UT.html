<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will affect installation expenses. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other elements that can affect this could be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
