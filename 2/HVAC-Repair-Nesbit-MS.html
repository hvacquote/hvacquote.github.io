<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that might impact the health of people who reside in the house. Pollutants could come from outside the house-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon going into your home from the ground listed below. An air pollutant might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, unstable organic compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or personal care items. Infections and germs, family pet dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
