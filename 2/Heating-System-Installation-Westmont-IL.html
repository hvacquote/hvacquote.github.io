<p>In basic, ductless AC units are more energy-efficient and environment-friendly than conventional A/cs. This is due to the fact that you can shut off individual rooms when you're not occupying them. On top of that, ductless ACs can raise and lower their temperature level quickly, saving you energy and money that routine HVAC compressors will waste by constantly starting up and turning themselves off.<p>
<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
