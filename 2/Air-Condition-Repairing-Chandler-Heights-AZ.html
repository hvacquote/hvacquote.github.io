<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  unit instead of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Space air conditioning unit feature a thermostat sensor, located behind the control board, which measures the temperature level of air entering the evaporative coil. The air conditioner might cycle constantly or behave unpredictably if the sensing unit is knocked out of position.
