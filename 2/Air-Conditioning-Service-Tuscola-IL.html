<p>When setting up radiant heating, you need to offer major thought to the type of flooring covering in the house. Ceramic tile works well due to the fact that it conducts and stores heat. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less efficient, but work fairly well. Carpeting will directly insulate the floor from the space, reducing effectiveness, so if you wish to set up carpet in a radiant-heated space, use a thin carpet with dense cushioning.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a regular oil change in your vehicle. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter better traps contaminants and particles in the air. Energy Star suggests replacing your filter once every three months. Throughout high usage months, check the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
