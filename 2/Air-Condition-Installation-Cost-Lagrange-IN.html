Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ might observe undesirable or moldy smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are becoming worse, talk with your doctor about them. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for great building management.<p>

If at any point in the process of bleeding the furnace something appears unusual or you lose self-confidence, it's time to call a professional. Similarly, if the process doesn't work, something else is incorrect and you need a technician to examine the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you find you need to do it frequently, it's probably time for an expert opinion.<p>
