<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech showed up right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the go to. They suggested replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the new part.
