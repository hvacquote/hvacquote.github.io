<h3>Ductless Heat Pump in Inver Grove Heights Minnesota</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the see. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the go to or the brand-new part. I was extremely delighted they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>
