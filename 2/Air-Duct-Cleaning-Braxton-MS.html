EPA estimates that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the number of episodes and intensity of signs in hundreds of countless asthmatic children, and might cause thousands of nonasth-matic children to develop the disease each year.

<p>Next, and perhaps simply as important when it concerns central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not be able to effectively cool the house on hot days. Thinking about bigger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the idea of an in-floor heating unit appears less like a high-end product and more like a need.
