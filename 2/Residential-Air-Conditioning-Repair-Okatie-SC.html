<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical material with time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
