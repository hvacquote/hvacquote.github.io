<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets ask for assessment and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, many of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very practical in gathering info on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to temporarily deal with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began.
