The probability of immediate reactions to indoor air contaminants depends upon a number of aspects consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions.

<p>The first ac system and refrigerators employed harmful or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could result in deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
