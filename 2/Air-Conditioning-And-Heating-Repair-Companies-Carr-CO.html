<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as just glowing systems.

When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the approach is described as radiant heating.<p>
