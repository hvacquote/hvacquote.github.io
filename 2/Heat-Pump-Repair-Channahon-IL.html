<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capacities.

The good news is that the one major downside of heatpump is that they can stop working in the incredibly hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
