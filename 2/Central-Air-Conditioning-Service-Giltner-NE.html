<h3>Leaking Ductwork in Giltner NE</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
