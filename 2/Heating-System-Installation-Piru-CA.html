<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil.

The next action is to defrost your air conditioning equipment if you discovered that your conditioning filter requires changing. The simplest method to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
