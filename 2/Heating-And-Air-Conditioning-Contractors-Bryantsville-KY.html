One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the floor surface. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the flooring are forced to withstand current, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>This in floor heating system consists of one thin continuous cable heating element woven into a mat that you set up under the tile. These heated floors are a task best done when revamping or altering the floor covering of an existing space or when including a brand-new room.
