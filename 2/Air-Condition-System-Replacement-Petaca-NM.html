<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most inexpensive. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
