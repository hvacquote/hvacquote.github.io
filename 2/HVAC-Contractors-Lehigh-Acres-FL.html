<p>They were fantastic! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially requested. They met my requirements completely by providing an expert quote with alternatives, without pressing extra products.

And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen with time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work till you purchase a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
