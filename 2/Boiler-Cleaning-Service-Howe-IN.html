<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets ask for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. The probability of instant responses to indoor air contaminants depends on a number of factors consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions. In some cases, whether an individual reacts to a pollutant depends upon specific sensitivity, which varies tremendously from person to individual. Some people can become sensitized to biological or chemical contaminants after duplicated or high level direct exposures.<p>
<p>The first air conditioning unit and fridges employed harmful or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might result in fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>While radon in water is not a problem in homes served by most public water supplies, it has been found in well water. If you've tested the air in your house and found a radon problem, and you have a well, get in touch with a laboratory licensed to determine radiation in water to have your water checked. Radon issues in water can be readily repaired. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more information.<p>

<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of heating systems have numerous control boards. The biggest, or just one in some heaters, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards collaborate the operation and control of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, however the new control board must be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t appropriately diagnosed, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable as soon as installed. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a professional to detect.<p>
<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly put or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which might go into neighboring ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and retirement home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
