<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
