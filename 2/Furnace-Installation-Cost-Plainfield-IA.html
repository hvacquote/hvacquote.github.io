<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
