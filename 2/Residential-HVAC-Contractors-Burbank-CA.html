<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, homes and work environments matters, especially since we spend most of our lives inside your home. Ac system help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in extremely damp environments or in cases where the a/c unit is extra-large, it might not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the a/c will require more energy to cool your house.

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
