<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else could come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to buy it. My spouse stated that she had actually seen an excellent evaluation for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent individuals I have actually met in a very long time. We require to support the real people who are there for us if we want to have options to ACME heating. Please do.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>A lot of well and city water does not usually include lead. Water typically picks up lead inside the home from family pipes that is made with lead products.

<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge pollutants.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in sufficient outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
