<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a reference later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Eliminate the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
