<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace professionals frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>For instance, problems arise when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not used to generate appropriate amounts of outside air. Inadequate ventilation also occurs if the air supply and return vents within each space are blocked or put in such a way that outdoor air does not actually reach the breathing zone of building occupants. Improperly located outside air consumption vents can also bring in air infected with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological pollutants that have actually multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning unit, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>
