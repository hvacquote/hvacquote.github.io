<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, select your contractor carefully, a number of the 'reputable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a trusted company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
