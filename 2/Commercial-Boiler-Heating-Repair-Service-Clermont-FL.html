<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not use car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash being available in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
