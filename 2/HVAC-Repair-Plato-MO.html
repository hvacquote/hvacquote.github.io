<p>Professional heater setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately fail. HVAC experts suggest following this fundamental rule when deciding whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the price of a new system, it's best to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>
