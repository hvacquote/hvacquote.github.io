<h3>Heating System Repair in Louisville Kentucky</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, but to have 2 significant parts stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>In a location where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great main heating systems. You'll wish to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperatures reach freezing. If temperatures drop and reach below freezing, your heating technician can install controls which automatically shut down the heat pump. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, efficiently heating the home in these conditions.<p>
