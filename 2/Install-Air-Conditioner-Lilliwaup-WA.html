<h3>Outdoor Air Conditioner in Lilliwaup Washington</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either since of visible development or a musty smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Dripping return ducts can likewise present wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter better traps impurities and debris in the air. Energy Star advises replacing your filter as soon as every 3 months. During high usage months, inspect the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
