<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, given that a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
