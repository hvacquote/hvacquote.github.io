Improving those components might increase the efficiency of the system as much or more than setting up new machinery.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it might grovel twice the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would use. That's due to the fact that it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to supply a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices set up just a few years back.<p>
