Carbon monoxide is a typical air toxin arising from natural gas that escapes into your home without being burned off.

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical product in time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
