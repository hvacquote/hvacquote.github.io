<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their overall power needs to not exceed the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems higher than the outdoor capability by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect much better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, given that the overall capability of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outside system. Basically, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that some of the rooms might not have an extremely comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the total power is not simple, because it takes into consideration not only the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate great but Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
