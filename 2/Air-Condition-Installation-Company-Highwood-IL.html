<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>

<p>As a number of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory service warranties stay in location. Furthermore, the tangible results of a PM is frequently hard to quantify, as one action specified the savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or ac system don't simply break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the result of recurring usage of a component that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely since the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing premature deterioration, resulting in holes and fractures. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the component.  a really useful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
