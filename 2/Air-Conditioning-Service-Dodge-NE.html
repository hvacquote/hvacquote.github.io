<p>These men have been excellent. At a realtor, I in some cases require contractors to give me an opinion for what deal with a home may cost. Recently I needed to call on these guys two times.

<p>The cost for heat pump installation also depends on the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, range in price from $2,500 to $7,500, consisting of installation.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
