<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company utilized 98% of the existing material acquired with your house. This company introduced a service agreement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the assessment on a very cold day they killed the furnace declaring health danger reason and contractor laws for their decision.
