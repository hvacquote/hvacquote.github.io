The fluid circulates around this loop, transferring the taken in heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
<p>Check these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your home are wide open.

Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
