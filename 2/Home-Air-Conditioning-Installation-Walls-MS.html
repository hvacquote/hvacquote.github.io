<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your home at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation expenses. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other factors that can affect this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years approximately. Loosen the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Image 6).<p>

<p>Both the active and inert active ingredients in pesticides can be natural compounds; therefore, both could add to the levels of air-borne organics inside homes.
