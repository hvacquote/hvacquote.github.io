<h3>Signs You Might Need an AC Repair Service at Rocky River OH</h3>
<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even little window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be changed or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, extremely filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
