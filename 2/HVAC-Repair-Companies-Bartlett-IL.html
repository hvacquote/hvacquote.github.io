The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they diagnosed the issue and repaired extremely quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>

The sound level is low and itâ $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>
