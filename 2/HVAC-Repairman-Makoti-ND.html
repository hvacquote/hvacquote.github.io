<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
