<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Make sure all the registers in your house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the lowered air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home.
