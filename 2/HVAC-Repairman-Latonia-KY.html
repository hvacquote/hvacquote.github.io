<p>I normally do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over options. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Iâ $ m actually choosy with my stuff. I like my equipment and home appliances initial, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with low-cost knock-offs. So purchasing this air conditioner to change my old one was rather of a tough reality. You canâ $ t trust the commercial nowadays. Am glad I got this however due to the fact that it has actually restored my faith in great manufacturing. I havenâ $ t had a problem with this new Provider I got considering that I bought it 7 months back. Itâ $ s just perfect.<p>
