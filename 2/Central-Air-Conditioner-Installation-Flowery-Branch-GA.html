<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day.

He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
