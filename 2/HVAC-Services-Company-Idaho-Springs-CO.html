<p>All houses require reliable ventilation. The quality of indoor air inside offices, schools, and other workplaces is very important not just for employees' comfort but also for their health. Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has been connected to symptoms like headaches, tiredness, difficulty focusing, and inflammation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Likewise, some specific illness have actually been connected to specific air impurities or indoor environments, like asthma with damp indoor environments. In addition, some exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not trigger immediate signs but can result in cancer after several years.<p>
<p>The first air conditioning unit and fridges employed poisonous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might result in fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
