<h3>HVAC Emergency Services in Startex SC</h3>
<p>Home heating systems are made complex systems that require the services of a contractor to set up. While you can definitely purchase your furnace yourself, most contractors won't guarantee the furnace or may not install it if you don't purchase it from them. Installation costs differ across the county, but begin at approximately $50 per hour up to $150 or more. It takes roughly five hours to install a small furnace and more to install a large one.<p>
<p>This is especially notable, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
