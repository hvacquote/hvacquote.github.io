<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a harmful toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " number one ecological risk to the health of kids in the United States." There are many ways in which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, weakening paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Prior to it was known how damaging lead could be, it was used in paint, gas, pipes, and lots of other products.<p>
<p>Excellent service within 24 hours and a reasonable rate. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and very extensive in describing what services would be performed. Likewise Camryn offered excellent customer care at the end of the visit by discussing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of ideas of some maintenance jobs we may want to have actually done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques used by some in the industry.<p>
