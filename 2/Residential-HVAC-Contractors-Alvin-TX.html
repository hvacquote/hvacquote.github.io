<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in Alvin TX</h3>

<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things initially. Make certain all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The minimized airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
