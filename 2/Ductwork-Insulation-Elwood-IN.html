<p>All houses require effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been stressed out from use. Another possible factor might be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the proper temperature level. Furnaces that kick on regularly may be because of a filthy filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal problem.
