Approval is not a condition of purchase.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.. Second of all like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the system has been running issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
