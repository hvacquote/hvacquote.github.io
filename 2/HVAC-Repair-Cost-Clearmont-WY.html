<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
