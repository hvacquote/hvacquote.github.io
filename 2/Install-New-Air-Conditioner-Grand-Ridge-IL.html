<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c unit works but your home does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, see Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
