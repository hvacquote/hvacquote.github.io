These systems can achieve a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just achieve an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other types of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE rates just how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to create the heating or cooling result.

<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
