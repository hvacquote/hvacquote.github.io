<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
