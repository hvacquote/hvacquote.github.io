<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system parts, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

<p>There are lots of sources of indoor air contamination in any home. These consist of combustion sources such as oil, gas, kerosene, coal, tobacco, and wood products; building materials and home furnishings as diverse as scrubby, asbestos-containing insulation, moist or damp carpet, and cabinetry or furnishings made from particular pressed wood products; products for family cleaning and maintenance, individual care, or pastimes; central heating and cooling systems and humidification gadgets; and outside sources such as radon, pesticides, and outside air contamination.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Specific kinds of HVAC units are a bit more costly than wall systems, ceiling or cassette systems are nicely concealed inside the ceiling in the class and are for that reason more discreet and visually pleasing to look at. They supply powerful airflow and are substantially more powerful than standard wall units and can, therefore, reduce the variety of units required and this can decrease installation and or replacement expenses where numerous HVAC units are required. Ducted commercial-grade cooling systems are BETTER for the instructional environment. They are typically the most costly alternative; nevertheless, they are likewise the most visually pleasing as the duct-work and internal systems hidden with minimal visibility.<p>
