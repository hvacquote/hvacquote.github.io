<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered by a Fulshear TX HVAC Company</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Ensure all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
