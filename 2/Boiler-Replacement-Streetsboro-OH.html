<h3>Assessing the Efficiency of Your HVAC System in Streetsboro OH</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness.

In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
