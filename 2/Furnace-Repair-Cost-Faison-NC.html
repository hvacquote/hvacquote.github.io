<p>The probability of immediate reactions to indoor air pollutants depends upon several factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important impacts. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a pollutant depends upon private level of sensitivity, which differs enormously from person to person. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological toxins after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical contaminants also.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO maintain the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor sensibly, a number of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales strategies that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For instance, humans breathe out co2, which in little amounts is not harmful, however might become hazardous if high concentrations are enabled to build up. Germs or micro-organisms might also be present within the ventilation system. They may spread out throughout the entire workplace or structure by ways of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
