<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Even after carrying out these tasks to increase the effectiveness and durability of your Seattle HVAC system, you must hire a professional to take on problems rapidly when they emerge and carry out thorough maintenance once a year or as needed.
