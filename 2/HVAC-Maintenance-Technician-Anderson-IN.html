<p>Many people underestimate the degree of the indoor air contamination issue. Air contamination is typically envisioned as the black smoke emitted from factories. Little thought is provided to tobacco smoke and the by-products of aerosol sprays, pesticides, cleaners, and paints utilized in the house. To intensify the issue, it is estimated that the average American invests 70 percent to 90 percent of his/her time inside your home, and more than half that time is spent in the home.<p>
<p>To be truthful, few of the facilities supervisors who utilize our indoor air quality tracking service concerned us because of that. Usually they were initially interested in remotely keeping track of some other aspect of their buildings, such as energy usage, in an effort to cut expenses. It wasn't till later on, as they continued dealing with us, that they learnt more about and executed indoor air quality keeping track of to provide a much healthier, safer building environment-- and to avoid the negative effects associated with indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
