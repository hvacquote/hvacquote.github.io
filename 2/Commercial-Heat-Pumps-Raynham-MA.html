This action is important so the system isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, along with all other types of heat pumps, have effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency, or POLICE OFFICER. It's a scientific way of determining how much energy the system moves versus just how much it uses. The majority of geothermal heat pump systems have Polices of 3.0 to 5.0. This implies for every single unit of energy used to power the system, three to 5 systems are provided as heat.<p>
