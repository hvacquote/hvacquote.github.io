<p>I usually don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
