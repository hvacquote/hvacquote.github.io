<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps at Grand Island NY</h3>
<p>We are service experts! As licensed contractors and experts in the field of heating and air-conditioning, we have the tools, the devices, and the experience to keep your devices running smoothly all year long. If it is emergency service that you require, twenty-four hours a day, 7 days a week, we are offered to help you! To help reduce service emergency situations, we offer service arrangements to keep your convenience system performing at peak efficiency.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
