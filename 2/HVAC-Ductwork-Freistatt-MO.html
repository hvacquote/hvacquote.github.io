<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize unit will not be able to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. Because it simply takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize system does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness. The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In reality, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>
