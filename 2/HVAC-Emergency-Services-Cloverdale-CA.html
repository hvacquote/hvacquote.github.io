<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Cloverdale CA Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or washed as conditions call for.

Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
