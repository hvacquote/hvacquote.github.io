<h3>The Way to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Alpine NJ</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
