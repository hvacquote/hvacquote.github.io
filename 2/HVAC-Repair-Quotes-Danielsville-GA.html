We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they required to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating unit. We selected getting something more pricey than a standard water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility costs. We feel that this new system will last a long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>

For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by lots of individuals.<p>
