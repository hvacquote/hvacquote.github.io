<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the same. As soon as the circuitry is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively cure and harden-- typically 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom flooring.<p>

While an area heating unit remains in usage, open a door from the room where the heating system lies to the remainder of the home and open a window a little.<p>
