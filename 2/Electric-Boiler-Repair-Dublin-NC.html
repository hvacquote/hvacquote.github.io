<p>There are a few main things that house owners will wish to consider when deciding which of the best AC systems they need to set up in their houses.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
