Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

Hazardous direct exposures to lead can be developed when lead-based paint is incorrectly eliminated from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in houses can likewise arise from lead dust from outdoor sources, including infected soil tracked inside, and use of lead in particular indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
