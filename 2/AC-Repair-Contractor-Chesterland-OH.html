<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summertime.

This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
