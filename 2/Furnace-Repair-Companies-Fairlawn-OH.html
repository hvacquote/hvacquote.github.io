<h3>The Way to Avoid Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Fairlawn OH</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
