<h3>Air Conditioning And Refrigeration in Clemmons NC</h3>
<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in hold-up functions when they're closed down and after that repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>We take a look at hints before we supply recommendations to change rather than repair a heating unit. Among the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are higher year after year, we understand the unit is not running effectively. It may be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
