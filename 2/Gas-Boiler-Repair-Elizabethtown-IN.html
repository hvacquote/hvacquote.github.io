<h3>Air Conditioning Service in Elizabethtown IN</h3>
<p>I usually don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Brian was every bit honest, pleasant and responsive. Jeremiah Bartula the plumbing discussed our alternatives prior to our work with Brian and was extraordinary, useful and informative - his work was impeccable! All of his assistants were diligent and courteous. The work site was left absolutely cleared and cleaned up. We would highly encourage others to go right to Berkshire Heating and A/c for all their heating and cooling requirements.<p>
