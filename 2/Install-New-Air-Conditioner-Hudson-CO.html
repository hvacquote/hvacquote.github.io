<h3>Central Heating Installation Service in Hudson CO</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes far more severe with lower outdoor temperatures, so heatpump are typically set up in tandem with a more conventional form of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heatpump during harsher winter season temperature levels. In this case, the heat pump is utilized efficiently throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
