<p>A specialized ac system that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the exact same air path. A basic ac system transfers heat out of the room due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, since all parts of the dehumidifier are in the exact same room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is actually warmed, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
