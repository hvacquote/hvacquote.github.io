<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Equipment costs are driven by the type of furnace at the heart of your home heating unit. Low-efficiency designs will cost less, but result in greater energy bills.

Electric heating systems begin at $395 and range approximately $1,700 or more depending on the brand and furnace size.<p>
