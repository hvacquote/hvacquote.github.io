<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Farmington MN</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, performed a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
