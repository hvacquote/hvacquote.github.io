<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location.

<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Leaky return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>There is a needed balance in making your choice though as systems with higher AFUE rankings frequently feature greater price. So, ensure to choose based on how often you will utilize your heater, the load that will be put on it and the frequency with which you plan on having it serviced each year. For the majority of temperate environments with low heating loads in the winter, having an extremely high ranked heating system is not constantly required.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they use air to exchange heat, in the exact same method as a cars and truck radiator or typical household a/c does.
