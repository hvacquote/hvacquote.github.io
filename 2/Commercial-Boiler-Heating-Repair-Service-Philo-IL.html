Rather than an easy sales task, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heater and situated ways we could have more even heat. He included these considerable however minor modifications in his bid. Because of current warmer summertimes and for ecological factors, we decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>

<p>The residential or commercial properties and composition of the soil in an area can affect the rate at which heat is conducted through the ground.

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor.

Before that happens, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>I am really impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years back and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
