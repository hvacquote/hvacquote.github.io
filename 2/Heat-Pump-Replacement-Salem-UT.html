<p>An undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run since it has to run longer than a properly sized system. A large-scale compressor also costs more to run due to the fact that it just takes more electrical energy to run a larger system. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a chance to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness.
