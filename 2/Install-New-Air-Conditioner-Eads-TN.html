<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory service warranties stay in place. Furthermore, the tangible results of a PM is frequently hard to quantify, as one reaction mentioned the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system don't simply break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the result of repetitive usage of an element that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing premature wear and tear, causing holes and cracks. , if that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the component.. a really useful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a client thousands.<p>
