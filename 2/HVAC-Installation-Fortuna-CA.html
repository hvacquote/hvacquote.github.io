<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair at Fortuna CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Many elements impact IAQ. These elements consist of poor ventilation (absence of outdoors air), problems controlling temperature level, low or high humidity, current improvement, and other activities in or near a building that can impact the fresh air entering into the structure. Sometimes, particular contaminants like dust from construction or renovation, mold, cleaning materials, pesticides, or other airborne chemicals (consisting of percentages of chemicals released as a gas gradually) may cause bad IAQ.<p>
