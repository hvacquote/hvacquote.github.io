<h3>The Way to Select An Expert HVAC Technician in Harlan IN</h3>
<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden floor joist system, below the wooded subsurface and last flooring finish. This is normally utilized in a 2nd or third-floor  location and makes the most of the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional thickness of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber radiant flooring heat hydronic system efficient, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipes to direct heat up.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
