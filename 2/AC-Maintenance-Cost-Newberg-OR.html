<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Problems in Newberg OR</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a reference later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
