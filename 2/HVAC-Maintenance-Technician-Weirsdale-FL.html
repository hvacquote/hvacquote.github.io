It sounds unbelievable, however furnace professionals frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well.

<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be quickly incorporated with existing systems such as traditional forced air or glowing floor heating or can be installed in a brand-new building. Forced air systems will need a water-to-air heat pump while hydronic radiant heat systems will require water-to-water heatpump.

Typically, a 3-ton setup must suffice for the typical house, but house size, heating and cooling needs, local geology and soil, and land accessibility are all elements which will affect the appropriate size for your particular house. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heat pump installation and can help you correctly size a system.<p>
