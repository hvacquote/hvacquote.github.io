<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment maker's to ensure your factory service warranties stay in location. Moreover, the tangible results of a PM is often hard to quantify, as one response mentioned the savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. The majority of pieces of a furnace or a/c do not simply break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the outcome of repetitive usage of a component that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature degeneration, leading to cracks and holes. If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and secures the component.  an extremely advantageous outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
