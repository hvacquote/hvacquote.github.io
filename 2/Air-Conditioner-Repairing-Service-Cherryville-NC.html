It sounds astounding, however furnace professionals often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on.

<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your house will not warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
