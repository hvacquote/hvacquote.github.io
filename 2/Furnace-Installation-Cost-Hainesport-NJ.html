When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise changes roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>We take a look at ideas prior to we supply suggestions to replace rather than repair a heater. One of the clues we look at is the cost of energy.

It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>
