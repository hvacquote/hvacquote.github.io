<p>A/c can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage.
