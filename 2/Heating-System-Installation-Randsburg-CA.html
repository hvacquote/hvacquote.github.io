<h3>HVAC Repair And You What You Need to Know in Randsburg CA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood just what the problem was and repaired it really rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
