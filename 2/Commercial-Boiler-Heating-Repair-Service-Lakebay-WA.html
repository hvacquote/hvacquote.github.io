<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure.
