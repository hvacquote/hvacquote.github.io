<p>Remember that the SEER ranking is computed using the very same set of temperatures across the board. The average summer temperature level to arrive at the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to get to the correct SEER ranking for your location, deduct 2 points for each 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER rating has to be at least 13 for all new cooling units manufactured in the United States.<p>

<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release pollutants.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>HVAC is an abbreviation for Ventilation, heating and air Conditioning, and refers to the climate control systems installed in homes or commercial homes. Their task is to move heated or cooled filtered air throughout the structure, to keep occupants of the structure comfortable. Literally every structure in Columbus or Franklin County, Ohio or the United States has some sort of environment control system set up.<p>
