<h3>Truth That You Might Not Know About a Boiler Heating System in Egg Harbor City NJ</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field.

<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
