<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ might notice unpleasant or musty odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems.
