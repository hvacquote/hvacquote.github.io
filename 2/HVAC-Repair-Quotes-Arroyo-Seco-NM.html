<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor in Arroyo Seco NM</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  unit instead of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for ac system repair, which you must look out for. First, you ought to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
