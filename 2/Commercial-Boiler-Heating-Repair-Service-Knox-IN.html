<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside unit as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Sean was very helpful. He is a really pleasant person to deal with. No pressure applied to buy additional stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no problems other than the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
