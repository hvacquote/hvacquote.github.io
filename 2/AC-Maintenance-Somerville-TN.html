<p>If you think a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
