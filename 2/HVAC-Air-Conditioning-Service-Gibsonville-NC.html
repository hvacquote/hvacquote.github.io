<p>If you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else might come except for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they needed to order it. My spouse stated that she had seen a fantastic evaluation for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most decent people I have actually met in a long time. We need to support the genuine individuals who are there for us if we desire to have options to ACME heating.
