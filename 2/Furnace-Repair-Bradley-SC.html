<h3>Advantages of Allergic Your Central Heating Boiler in Bradley SC</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present trend in house building and construction is to reduce air leak through cracks and other openings in walls, roofing systems, and floors. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in automobiles in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this type of application, however is still imported and can be bought and used by licensed HVAC service technicians. For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by lots of individuals.<p>
