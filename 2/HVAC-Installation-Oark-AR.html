<p>Expert heater setups. However, even the best-maintained heating system will eventually stop working.

<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everybody can afford, many Seattleites must discover methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service.

<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is frequently vital to determining the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such info can in some cases be obtained by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the company. If keeping an eye on information is not offered, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union agent should ask for that the company have air monitoring tests performed. Evaluation of this information may determine potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when pollutant concentrations are very low, monitoring data might not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
