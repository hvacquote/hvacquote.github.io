<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
