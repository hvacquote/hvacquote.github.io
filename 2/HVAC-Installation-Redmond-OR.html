If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even an unclean burner.<p>

<p>Since it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate since it just takes more electrical power to run a bigger system. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature shows. In fact, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
