<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
