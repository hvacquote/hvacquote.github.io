<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to find an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Because it exhausts warm air out the top, do not position the condenser under a deck or completely confine it. Any airflow limitation will decrease the unit's efficiency. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>
<p>Though it might be hard to think, the air inside your house can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are notorious for decreasing the air quality in your house, but there are many other toxins that can not just unclean up the air, however lead to other health issues.

If keeping track of data is not offered, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative need to ask for that the company have air monitoring tests carried out. Review of this data may determine possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are really low, keeping track of information might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
