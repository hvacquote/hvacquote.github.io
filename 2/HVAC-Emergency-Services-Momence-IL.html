<p>Geothermal heat pumps are exceptionally effective, because ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature level is constantly at a constant temperature. These systems can achieve a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only attain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other kinds of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). COP rates how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling impact. Most ground source heat pumps have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for each system of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, roughly 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the form of heat.<p>
