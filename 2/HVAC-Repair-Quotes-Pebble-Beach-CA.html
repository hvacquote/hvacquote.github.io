<p>Lead has long been recognized as a damaging toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " number one ecological danger to the health of children in the United States." There are numerous methods which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was known how harmful lead might be, it was used in paint, gas, water pipes, and many other products.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide need to be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements used for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might also be essential.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't turn off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't release heat efficiently and will keep the unit running.

Before checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick up until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
