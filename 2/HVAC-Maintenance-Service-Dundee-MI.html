<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioner system that sits outside your house. Heat pumps operate on electrical power and work like air conditioners in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This allows them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heater (like a space heating unit) with the exact same amount of electrical power. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

He included these considerable however small adjustments in his quote. Since of current warmer summer seasons and for environmental reasons, we chose to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensors: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface ignitor) or electronic lighter spoils, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it shuts down quickly. This is an extremely typical repair.
