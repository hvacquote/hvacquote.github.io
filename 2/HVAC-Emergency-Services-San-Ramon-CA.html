First, you must examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
