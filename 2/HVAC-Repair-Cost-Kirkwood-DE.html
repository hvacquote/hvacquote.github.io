<p>Expert heater installations. However, even the best-maintained heating system will eventually stop working. HVAC professionals recommend following this standard rule when choosing whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost majority the cost of a new system, it's finest to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than essential.<p>

<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, but to have two significant elements fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
