<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic.

Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<h3>Is Your Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Putnam IL?</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>

<h3>Furnace Maintenance in Putnam IL</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
