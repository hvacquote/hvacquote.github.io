<p>All modern cooling systems, even little window package units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will require to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
