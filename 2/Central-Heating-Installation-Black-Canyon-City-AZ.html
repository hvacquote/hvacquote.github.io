<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
