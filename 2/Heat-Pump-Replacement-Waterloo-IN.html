Atmospheric pressure differences produced by these forces move air-borne pollutants from locations of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure through any readily available opening in building walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is little, air will move up until the within pressure is equal to the exterior.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a routine oil modification in your automobile.

Throughout high use months, inspect the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
