<p>Co2 (CO2) is a reasonably simple to measure surrogate for indoor toxins given off by humans, and associates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are uncommonly high inside might cause occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in most structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a pipe two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "tough part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
