<p>Acknowledged as a leader in the HVAC market, Bard Manufacturing combines quality products and exceptional service with development and technological advances to deliver high-performance heating and cooling items all over the world. A multi-split system 56 is a standard split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and permits cooling or heating of a number of rooms with one external system.
