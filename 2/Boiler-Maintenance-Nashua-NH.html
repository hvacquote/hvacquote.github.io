<p>A cars and truck's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being old and unclean.

<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time.

We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material gradually. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
