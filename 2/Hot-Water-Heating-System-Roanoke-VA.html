<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me relating to an unusually high bill that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he understood that I had actually called the service supervisor and left a message of issue. Ron had actually identified the problem area in looking over the costs. He solved the concern in one day, had actually changed the costs to what I considered reasonable before he recalled, understood what might have triggered the issue and had a strategy to insure that it would not occur again. I have actually considered All Points a company with stability for the 9 years we have used them. This experience validates that.<p>
<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not offer off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off.

Before checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to work till you purchase a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
