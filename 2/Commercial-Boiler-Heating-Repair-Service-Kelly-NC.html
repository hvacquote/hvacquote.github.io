<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather substantial.<p>
