<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a recommendation in the future).

The female crimp ports need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
