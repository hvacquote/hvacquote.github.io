<p>How climate change affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning system boost. This increase has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
