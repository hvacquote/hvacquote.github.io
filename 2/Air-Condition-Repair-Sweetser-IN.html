First, use exterior-grade pushed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an alternative, think about using solid wood items. Second of all, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make certain that an effective wetness barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet. If it ends up being wet, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated.<p>
