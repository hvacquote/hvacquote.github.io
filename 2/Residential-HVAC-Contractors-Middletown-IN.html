<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your home will not warm up.

<p>Air conditioning system can create a great deal of water since they eliminate wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In truth, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location.

<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC system. The best thing about G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the problem and repaired really quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>The split system is the most typical. Many people are used to seeing this enter the yards of houses. With split system units, the majority of the components are housed in a metal box outside of the home. Nevertheless, there are some internal parts as well. Split systems are perfect for cooling multiple rooms simultaneously, however are not extremely energy effective. Therefore, one pro is not having loud equipment in the home. At the same time, the con would be that those who use this might invest more cash on cooling expenses in the long run because of the lower energy performance.<p>
