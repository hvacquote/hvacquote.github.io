<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you ought to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
