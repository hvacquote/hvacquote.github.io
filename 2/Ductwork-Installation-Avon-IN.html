This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of various heater, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable concepts.

When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>
