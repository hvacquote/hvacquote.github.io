<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in vehicles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12.

For systems requiring just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by many individuals.<p>

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature of the flooring. All electrical wiring for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is unblocked and dry.<p>
<p>Indoor air pollution comes from a variety of sources; the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified building products, home furnishings, and mold as serious concerns, but much of the danger also originates from burning things.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from inside and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
