<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is typically vital to identifying the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such information can sometimes be acquired by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the employer. If keeping track of information is not offered, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative must request that the employer have air tracking tests conducted. Review of this information might identify potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. However, when contaminant concentrations are very low, keeping an eye on data might not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
