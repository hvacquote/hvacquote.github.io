The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health identified insufficient ventilation as the main problem in over half the office indoor air examinations it has actually performed. Investigations conducted in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually discovered the very same to be true. These examinations exposed that appropriate ventilation is necessary in preserving great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>In addition, employee health symptoms such as colds, headaches, drowsiness, irritation, and irregular breathing may be brought on as the result of temperature extremes, improper humidity levels, and too much or too little air circulation. Work environment temperatures must be preserved in between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%.
