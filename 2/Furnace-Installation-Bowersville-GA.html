<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating systems are still widely used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>
