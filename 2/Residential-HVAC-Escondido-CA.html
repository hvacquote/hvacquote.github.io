The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
