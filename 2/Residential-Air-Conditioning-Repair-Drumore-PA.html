<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps at Drumore PA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though most air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven. When the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips, screeching noises from a belt-drive air handler typically take place. In many cases, the belt is poorly lined up or used and requires replacement. Follow the guidelines above under Air Conditioner Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's handbook.<p>
