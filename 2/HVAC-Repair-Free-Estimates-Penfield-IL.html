A 2500 square foot home will need a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will affect installation costs. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other elements that can impact this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. A ductless system has an integrated performance advantage since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Ductless heatpump are fantastic for additions because they don't require any new ductwork to be installed. Due to the fact that a system is set up in each room or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you exist.<p>
