<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
<p>Place the solar storage tank near the standard hot water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are accessible if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. It is most likely that it is supported by the plumbing if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. Set up unions at the tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed.<p>
