The average summer temperature to come to the SEER ranking is 83 degrees, so to reach the appropriate SEER rating for your location, deduct 2 points for each 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER ranking needs to be at least 13 for all brand-new cooling systems manufactured in the United States.<p>
<p>Terrific service within 24 hours and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was really comprehensive and on-time in describing what services would be carried out. Likewise Camryn supplied fantastic customer service at the end of the appointment by describing exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few suggestions of some maintenance tasks we might want to have carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies used by some in the industry.<p>
