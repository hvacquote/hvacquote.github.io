<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, much of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
