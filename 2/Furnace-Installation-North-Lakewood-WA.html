Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Consider possible effects of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, especially directions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating unit properly adjusted.
