<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, however to have two major components stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Some health effects might show up quickly after a single direct exposure or duplicated exposures to a pollutant. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such immediate results are usually short-term and treatable.
