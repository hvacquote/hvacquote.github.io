<h3>Working of an HVAC System in Oak Ridge TN</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even small window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>

<p>All heating systems have some level of air purification. From one of the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some fundamental maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping airborne contaminants flowing through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping reduce the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal parts like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
