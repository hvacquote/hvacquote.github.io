<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces heated up by radiators are prone to cold areas", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot next to the radiators. This normally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your home escape out of the window. Radiant heat supplies heat from the flooring up throughout the space with no cold spots or stuffiness in the location being warmed.<p>
