These toxins pick your furnishings, your woodwork, and even in your lungs. Plus, concerns like bad humidity can promote the growth of mold, create skin and hair problems, and a host of other undesirable problems.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like prolonged vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found someone to correctly service and the system has been operating issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
