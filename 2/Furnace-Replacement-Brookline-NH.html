<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
