<p>We look at clues before we supply advice to change instead of repair a heating unit. One of the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are greater year after year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It may be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be squandering money by not changing the older system.<p>

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the like geothermal energy though, and the 2 must not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water supply, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for creating power in the form of electrical power. The two operations utilize various processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated up to boiling point to accomplish its objectives.<p>
