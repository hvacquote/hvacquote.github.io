<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
