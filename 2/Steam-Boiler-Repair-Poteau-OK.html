<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay.
