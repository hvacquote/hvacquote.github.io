<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they give me concern and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC.
