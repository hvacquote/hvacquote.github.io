Your heating and cooling contractor should examine and, if needed, upgrade the structure envelope. For instance, he might seal spaces and cracks in the external walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs. Insulation may be a more efficient option to your cooling problems than replacing your equipment.<p>
<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall.

Since they don't need any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Due to the fact that a system is installed in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
