<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Evergreen CO</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even small window bundle units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Furthermore, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Many aspects impact IAQ. These factors include bad ventilation (absence of outside air), issues managing temperature level, low or high humidity, recent improvement, and other activities in or near a building that can impact the fresh air entering into the structure. In some cases, specific pollutants like dust from building or remodelling, mold, cleaning materials, pesticides, or other airborne chemicals (consisting of small amounts of chemicals released as a gas in time) might trigger poor IAQ.<p>
