<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets ask for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. However, a lot of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are ending up being typical features of eco-friendly houses as part of the growing green building movement. Green projects accounted for 20 percent of all recently developed homes in the U.S. last year.

<h3>Direct Purchase HVAC Equipment in Greenwood MO</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing pattern in house building is to decrease air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofing systems, walls, and floors. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air helps and waters down indoor contaminants tire them from the home.<p>

<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As an initial step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set more powerful indoor standards based on the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor devices through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>We recommend utilizing our insulation boards when setting up over concrete slabs. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when used in combination with underfloor heating by functioning as a really efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of enabling heat to heat up the concrete slab below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>Lastly, if you do determine a particularly energy-efficient in-floor heater and select to install it in your house, you could be eligible for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor expenses. (And these costs can be substantial. According to figures collected by Angie's List, house owners can anticipate to pay in between $6 and $16 per square foot, not consisting of tax and labor, for a radiant heat system.) Consult the U.S. Department of Energy's Database of State Rewards for Renewable Energy (DSIRE) to see if there are refunds, loans or tax deductions readily available for the installation of a more efficient in-floor heating system where you live.<p>
