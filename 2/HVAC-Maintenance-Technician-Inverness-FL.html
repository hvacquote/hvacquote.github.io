<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>

<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around repairing the issue, all the while explaining everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will certainly utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
