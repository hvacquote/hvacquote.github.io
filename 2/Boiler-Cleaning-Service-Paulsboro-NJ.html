<h3>HVAC System in Paulsboro NJ</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
