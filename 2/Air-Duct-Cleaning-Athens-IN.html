<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
