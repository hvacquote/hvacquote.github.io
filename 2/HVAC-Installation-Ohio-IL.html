<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems in homes. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating enough outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the home. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outside your house. Heat pumps run on electrical energy and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This permits them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like an area heating system) with the same amount of electricity. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
