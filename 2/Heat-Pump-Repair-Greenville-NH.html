<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that may impact the health of people who live in the home. Pollutants could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, backyard trash burning, or radon going into your house from the ground below. An air contaminant could also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or personal care products. Infections and bacteria, pet dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit contaminants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outside air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
