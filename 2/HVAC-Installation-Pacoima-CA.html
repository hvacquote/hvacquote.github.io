<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by using wise innovation.

This service can be provided to any commercial client, not simply throughout new building and construction.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Make certain all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>
