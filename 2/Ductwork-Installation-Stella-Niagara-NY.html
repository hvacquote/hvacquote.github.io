This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps at Stella Niagara NY</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even little window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions require.

In addition, really unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
