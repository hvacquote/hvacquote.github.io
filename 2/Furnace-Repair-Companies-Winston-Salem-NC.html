I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He assisted me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again.
