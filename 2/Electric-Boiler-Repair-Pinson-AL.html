<p>Both need to be kept tidy since an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to routinely clean the condenser coil.

<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit.
