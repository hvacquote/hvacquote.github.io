<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

The bacterium forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, consisting of chlorine.

<p>Outdoor pollutants. Outside particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and irritants found in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates.
