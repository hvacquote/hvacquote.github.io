<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
