<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heaters are still extensively used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>More typical in relatively older houses, a boiler-based heating system utilizes electrical power, oil or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in individual spaces.

More recent gas boilers need to accomplish 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers need to achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
