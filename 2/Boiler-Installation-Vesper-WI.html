<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a referral in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
