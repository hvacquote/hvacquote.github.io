<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
