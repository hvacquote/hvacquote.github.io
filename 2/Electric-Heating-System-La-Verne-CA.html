<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
