<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to supply adequate changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A common component essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
