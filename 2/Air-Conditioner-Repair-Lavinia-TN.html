<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent gos to.<p>

This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers.
