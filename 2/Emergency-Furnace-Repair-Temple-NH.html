<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
