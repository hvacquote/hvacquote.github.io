<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not use auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in every month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year.
