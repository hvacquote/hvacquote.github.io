<h3>Tips To Help You Repair Your Furnace in Wittmann AZ</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating system. We chose getting something more pricey than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy expenses. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
