<h3>Electric Heating Systems in Quarryville PA</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>The installation was quick, professional and very well done. The installers were respectful and understood exactly what to do. I am an engineer by occupation and acknowledge quickly people who are good at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are excellent and do not miss out on information that produces a job effectively done. I very highly suggest the 2 gentlemen as they are exceptional at what they do. Thank you to them as they certainly deserve my thanks and gratitude for a task well done.<p>
