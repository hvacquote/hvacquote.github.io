<h3>Assessing the Performance of Your HVAC System at Spring Lake NC</h3>

After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Because an air conditioning system moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept clean. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise essential to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
