The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air assists and waters down indoor contaminants tire them from the house.<p>

A voided service warranty won't do you any great ought to the system stop working or malfunction. Do it right from the get-go and work with a licensed person with the experience to set up the system.<p>
