<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The goal is to offer adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this.

The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
