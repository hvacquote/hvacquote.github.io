<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent informing me about our system, and left having fixed the problem with an easy repair he did on-site, not replacing the whole part.

His time and proficiency to FIX the concern cost us less than what we paid the other company just to do a somewhat uncertain diagnostic.<p>
<p>Since it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your home via ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for effectiveness. Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively straightforward process. Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite expensive if you are including on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
