<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to offer your home that best temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those typical air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can result in costly repairs down the road. So, make certain to change your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service strategy which generally consists of a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
