<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut down completely.<p>
<p>I'll start with a gas furnace because it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion procedure. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a relatively uncomplicated procedure. Installing a new gas furnace system can be quite expensive if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
