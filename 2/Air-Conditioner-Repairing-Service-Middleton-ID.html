<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you should check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
