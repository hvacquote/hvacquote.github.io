<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network access, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity expert at a large seller who asked not to be named since he did not have approval to speak on the record, it prevails for big retail operations to have a team that consistently keeps track of energy intake and temperature levels in stores to minimize costs (especially during the night) and to alert store supervisors if temperature levels in the shops vary outside of an acceptable range that could avoid clients from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>The primary factor homeowners do not acquire an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 each year, depending on the amount of services provided.
