<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heating systems, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>There are some ranges of mold that contain hazardous substances (mycotoxins). However, exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible for the most part, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the launched spores.
