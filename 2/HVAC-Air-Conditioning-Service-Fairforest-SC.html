<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Fairforest SC</h3>
<p>Most people don't know how humidity is gotten rid of from your Houston Midtown Tx house. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic likewise acts a dehumidifier. All the damp hot air that passes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then gotten rid of from the space that is being cooled.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode".

This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
