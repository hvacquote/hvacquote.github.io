<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you should check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
