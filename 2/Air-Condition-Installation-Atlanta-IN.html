<p>My eldest son always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it really didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think about anything else except replacing it. The one I got deserves every cent.
