<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Leaky return ducts can likewise present wetness. Again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types when installing the entire system. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.
