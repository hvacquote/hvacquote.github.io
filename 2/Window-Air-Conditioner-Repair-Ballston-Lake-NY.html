<p>How climate change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system increase. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
