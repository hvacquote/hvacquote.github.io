<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heatpump, everything requires to be changed eventually. As devices ages, it becomes less efficient.
