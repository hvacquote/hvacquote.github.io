<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside unit as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
