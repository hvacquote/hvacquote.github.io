<p>We're Not Simply Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to watch out for is the dust that collects throughout summers. The very best thing to do is ensuring that the heating system burners are examined and cleaned thoroughly before chillier seasons begin.

<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues.

If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
