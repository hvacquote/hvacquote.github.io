<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have two different systems (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioner into a heatpump While room cooling supplies optimum versatility, when utilized to cool many spaces at a time it is generally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
