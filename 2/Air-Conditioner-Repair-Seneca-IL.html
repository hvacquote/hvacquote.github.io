<h3>Air Condition Service Near me in Seneca IL</h3>
<p>We called Elite A/C on one of the hottest days of summertime( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to evaluate situation & decided to choose them for the work. I enjoy to say that not just did we get the central air conditioning going but also replaced the heating unit which was old. Everyone we talked with from beginning to end were really expert, considerate and the work was very efficiently done. I would highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Great service within 24 hr and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was very thorough and on-time in explaining what services would be performed. Likewise Camryn supplied great customer support at the end of the visit by explaining exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of suggestions of some maintenance jobs we may wish to have actually performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies utilized by some in the industry.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is absorbed from inside your home and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
