<h3>Heating And Cooling Repair in Gonzales CA</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
