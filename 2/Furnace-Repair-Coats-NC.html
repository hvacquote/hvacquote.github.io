<h3>Matters Every Homeowner Knows About Selecting Coats NC HVAC Companies</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes far more severe with lower outdoor temperature levels, so heat pumps are typically installed in tandem with a more standard type of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heatpump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heatpump is utilized effectively throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
