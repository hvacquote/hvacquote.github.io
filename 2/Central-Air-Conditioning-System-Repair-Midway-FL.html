The unit runs quietly and efficiently, however to have two major components fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>Sun Ray Solar water heater require relatively little attention. However, just like any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is vital to keep the system functioning smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system are similar to those of traditional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank should be checked for leakages, the system must be flushed occasionally to get rid of tank and collected impurities (scaling in tough water areas).

The collector's glass can be rinsed regularly to remove dust gathered in order to enhance collector efficiency.<p>
