<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, but to have 2 significant elements fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Several initiatives imagine to decrease indoor air contamination by limiting VOC emissions from products. There are guidelines in France and in Germany, and many voluntary ecolabels and ranking systems consisting of low VOC emissions criteria such as EMICODE, 19 M1, 20 Blue Angel 21 and Indoor Air Convenience 22 in Europe, along with California Requirement CDPH Section 01350 23 and several others in the U.S.A..
