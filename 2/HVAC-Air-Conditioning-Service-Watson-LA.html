<p>The icing issue becomes much more serious with lower outdoor temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly set up in tandem with a more conventional kind of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heat pump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is utilized efficiently during the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the conventional heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>There's a huge distinction in between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common kind of home heating-- convection. Over the past century, the majority of homes in cooler environments were warmed by convection, rather than radiation. Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the rooms for the warm air to keep the walls, floors and ceilings heated. In turn, the items in the room, like furnishings and people, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>
