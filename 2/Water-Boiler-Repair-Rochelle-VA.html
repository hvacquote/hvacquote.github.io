<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Rochelle Virginia</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it might suck up to twice the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would use. That's due to the fact that it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to offer a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than devices installed simply a couple of years back.<p>
