Transmittable illnesses, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are sent through the air. Molds and mildews launch disease-causing toxins. Signs of health problems triggered by biological pollutants consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, lethargy, fever, and digestive problems.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house occupants. Unlike other kinds of a/c unit, evaporative coolers depend on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its air duct system; this cooled outside air should be permitted to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to comprehend and preserve.<p>
