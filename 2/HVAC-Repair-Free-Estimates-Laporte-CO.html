<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>

<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Ensure all the registers in the house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the lowered airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it.
