<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
