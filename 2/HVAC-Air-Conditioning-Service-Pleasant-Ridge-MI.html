<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most affordable. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor.

With time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
