<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Holly Springs NC</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be bought and used by licensed HVAC service technicians. For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by many people.<p>
