<p>Inquire about training and certifications. An excellent location to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's type of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there haven't troubled with it!

<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release toxins.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>It is not practical to create a universal guideline fit for all in regards to direct exposure and health because immunity differs considerably from specific to specific.

The structure type included both residential and commercial. Most of samples analyzed were evaluated positive for fungis and germs.<p>
