<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
