<p>I have been using them for many years for my companies, my own houses and my property customers' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He assisted me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again. He is truthful, reliable, and affordable on cost. It's difficult to find a sincere AC man and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home.
