<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside system as near your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

No extra charge.<p>
