<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in tons. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
