<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have been around because the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floors and tied them into a hot water supply.

<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. Since up to 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has a built-in effectiveness benefit. Ductless heatpump are great for additions because they don't require any new ductwork to be set up. Because a system is installed in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>
