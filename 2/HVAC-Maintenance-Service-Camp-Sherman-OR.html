<h3>Emergency Furnace Repair in Camp Sherman Oregon</h3>
<p>These guys have actually been fantastic. At a realtor, I sometimes require contractors to offer me a viewpoint for what work on a home may cost.

Even when it was news my client probably would not want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the sincerity. Integrity isn't just their name, its a company design they take seriously. You guys are officially on speed dial. Talk with you quickly.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
