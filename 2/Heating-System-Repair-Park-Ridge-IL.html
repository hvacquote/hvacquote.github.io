<p>In 2011, NASA was on the lookout for an a/c system to install in their lunar electric rover. They decided they required professional assistance and sought advice from various suppliers. Finally, after a strenuous choice process, the space agency picked Dometic. We've had a great deal of firsts throughout the years, however this custom-made job presented special difficulties for our engineers," said a spokesperson for Dometic.

<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur gradually because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to do the trick up until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you may select to change the outdoor compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency unit.
