<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance at Fulton CA</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a reasonably simple to measure surrogate for indoor toxins given off by humans, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are uncommonly high inside your home may cause occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are typically 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of co2 in most buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
