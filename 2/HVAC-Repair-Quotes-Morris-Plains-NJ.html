EPA prepares to do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or might become, a trusted means of reducing the health threat from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, provides further info on air-cleaning devices to reduce indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>A/c can likewise be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
