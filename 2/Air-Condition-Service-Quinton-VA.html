The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor impurities and helps tire them from the home.<p>
