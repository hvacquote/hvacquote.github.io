<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The goal is to offer sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A common component essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
