<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
