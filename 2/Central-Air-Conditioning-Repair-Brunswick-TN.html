<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
