<p>Specific types of HVAC units are a little bit more costly than wall units, ceiling or cassette units are neatly concealed inside the ceiling in the classroom and are therefore more discreet and visually pleasing to take a look at.

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

This can lead to the capacity for substantial illness.<p>
