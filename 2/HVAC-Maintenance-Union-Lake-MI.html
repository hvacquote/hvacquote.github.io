<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more problems, given that a few of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
