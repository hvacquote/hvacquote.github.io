They will search for indications of rust, leakages, and back draft and repair the issue during their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S).
