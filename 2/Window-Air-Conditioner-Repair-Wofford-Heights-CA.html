<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside system as near your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to effectively service and the unit has been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
