<p>Fantastic Item! Delivery was sort of unusual being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The item was extremely lite weight and takes some time to apply. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we resolved issues. I would advise this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

<h3>Natural Gas Furnace Service in Norwood NJ</h3>
<p>Geothermal heating is one of the most efficient heating sources in regards to environmental expenses. It safeguards the environment from hazardous digging, fracking, or contaminants because the energy used to heat your house is extracted directly from the ground. Geothermal systems use compressor and evaporator systems comparable to those used in refrigerators. While geothermal systems do utilize some electricity, they release far less greenhouse gases or other contaminants than heating systems that require gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct runs between $300 to $500 usually.

Nevertheless, select your contractor sensibly, a number of the 'reliable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners.
