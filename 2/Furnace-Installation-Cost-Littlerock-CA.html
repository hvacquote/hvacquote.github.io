<p>I have been using them for many years for my businesses, my own houses and my realty clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with various costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me problem shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again. He is truthful, trustworthy, and affordable on cost. It's difficult to find a sincere AC person and I'm delighted I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
