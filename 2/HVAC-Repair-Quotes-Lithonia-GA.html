<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up frequently, they can end up being blocked with debris that can restrict airflow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's effectiveness. Unclean filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down totally. By comparison, examining and replacing a furnace filter can typically be carried out in simply a couple of minutes, typically without any tools needed. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
