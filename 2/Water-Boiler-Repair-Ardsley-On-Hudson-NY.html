<p>Filters can get filthy easily, specifically if you live in a place that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, debris, germs, and tidy the air. They are accountable for preserving the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will eventually stop performing as you expect it to if they're not cleaned and replaced regularly.

<p>The primary health effect connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
