<p>A geothermal heater is more reliable than options, and is not affected by any external factors, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar energy. For instance, wind energy can just be used when there is wind, while solar energy relies on routine sunshine to work effectively.

This makes geothermal heating a available and trustworthy  source of energy.<p>
