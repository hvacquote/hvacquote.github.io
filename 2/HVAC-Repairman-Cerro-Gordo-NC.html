<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace professionals typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall.

Due to the fact that an unit is set up in each room or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>
