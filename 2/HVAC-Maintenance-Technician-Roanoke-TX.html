Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
