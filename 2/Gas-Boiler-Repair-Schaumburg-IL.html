<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace professionals typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
