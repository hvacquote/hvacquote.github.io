This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioning system into a heatpump While room a/c offers maximum flexibility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is typically more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
