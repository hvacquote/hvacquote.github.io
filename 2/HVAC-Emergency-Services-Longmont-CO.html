EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, provides more information on air-cleaning devices to reduce indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Prior to you head out and buy an air conditioner, there are a couple of things to decide first. Where are you going to be setting up the a/c unit? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How large should the a/c be? Too big and you'll face issues with short-cycling, which can harm the ac system and reduce its life. Too little and your a/c won't have the ability to cool the house appropriately. When going shopping for a new AC system, these are simply a few of the elements that you need to take into account. Each choice can and will substantially impact your system's performance, which is why you can't manage to disregard any of them.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you must examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
