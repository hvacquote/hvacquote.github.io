<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Measurement procedures are being developed and demonstrated to evaluate building ventilation and indoor contaminant concentrations. These treatments range from advanced tracer gas methods utilized predominantly in constructing research efforts to less involved procedures that can be used by developing operators.

<p>The installation was quick, professional and effectively done. The installers were respectful and knew exactly what to do.

<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Allergens found in indoor air are primarily biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can become air-borne, and therefore, are easily breathed in. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the existence of cat irritant might cause an asthma attack in people with feline allergies, but not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Over the previous few years, there has actually been some publicity suggesting that houseplants have been shown to reduce levels of some chemicals in laboratory experiments. There is currently no evidence, nevertheless, that a sensible number of houseplants remove considerable amounts of toxins in houses and workplaces. Since excessively damp soil might promote the development of microorganisms which can impact allergic individuals, indoor houseplants should not be over-watered.<p>
