<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning On Your Mentor OH Home</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
