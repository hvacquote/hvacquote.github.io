<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol result, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which might get in neighboring ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical facilities and retirement home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outdoor water fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
