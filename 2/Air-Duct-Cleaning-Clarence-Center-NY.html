<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Issues in Clarence Center NY</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
