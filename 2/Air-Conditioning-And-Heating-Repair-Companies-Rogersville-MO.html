<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Numerous AC units come with a variety of special features that can further enhance performance and effectiveness. For example, property owners might wish to try to find one that includes a built-in filter light that will alert you when the air filter needs to be changed.

Obviously, more functions indicate higher central air conditioning costs.<p>
