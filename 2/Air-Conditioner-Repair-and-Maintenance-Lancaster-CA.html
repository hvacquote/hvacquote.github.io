<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely useful in gathering information on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to briefly handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear interaction about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started.
