These calculations take into account things such as the size of your home, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is essential so the system isn't too little or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>For example, pollutants might gather within the air diffusers and grills, presenting contaminants into the environment. Or if the outdoor air intake is located near a source of moisture or other outside toxin, it might work as a path to carry the impurities inside.
