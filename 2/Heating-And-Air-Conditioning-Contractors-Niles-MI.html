No matter what the type of home HVAC system, sufficient air flow (ventilation), proper filtration, and humidity manage all contribute to a healthy indoor air environment. > Also, frequent maintenance of the HVAC system will make sure that it is running safely and not adding to or causing an indoor air problem.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

She didn't need a air filtration system, however they talked her into it.<p>
