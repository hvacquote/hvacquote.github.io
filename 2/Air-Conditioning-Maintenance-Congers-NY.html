<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not just was the cost terrific however Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
