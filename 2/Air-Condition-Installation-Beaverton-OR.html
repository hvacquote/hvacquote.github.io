<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price excellent but Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>In addition, HVAC companies typically should pay licensing and certification fees, so make sure to have a look at the particular HVAC licensing requirements in your state.

<p>Whatever heating unit you install, it's essential that it's sized properly for your house. Too big and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should. Plus, it will use excessive energy for the quantity of heat you desire produced. If the system is too little, then your house will not be heated up properly and the system will need to constantly go to try to heat the whole home, which will increase heating costs.<p>
<p>Because they eliminate moisture from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have an usually plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the system or flood the area. To handle condensate issues, please see Air conditioning system Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
