<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen with time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts.
