Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the standard hot water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
<p>Place the solar storage tank near the standard water heater.

It is likely that it is supported by the plumbing if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. If the tank or heat exchanger ever require to be replaced, install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut.<p>
