<h3>Air Condition Service Near me in Gladewater TX</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
