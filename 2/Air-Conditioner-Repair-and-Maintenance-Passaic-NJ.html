<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
