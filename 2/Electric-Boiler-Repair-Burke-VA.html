<p>We look at ideas before we offer recommendations to replace instead of repair a heating system. One of the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy bills are greater every year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more effective design, then you would be squandering cash by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Heavy manufacturing industries use a relatively small portion of air conditioning specialists and other HVAC employees, but pay some of the market's highest salaries. Electrical power generating companies top the list, with a typical wage of $34.09 per hour or $70,920 per year. Vehicle parts producers, aerospace producers and car producers are all within a few cents of each other at roughly $31 per hour, or over $64,000 annually. Railways are another high-wage company, at approximately $29.33 per hour or $61,000 annually.<p>
