<h3>Furnace Installation Cost in Willow Springs IL</h3>
<p>I have been using them for many years for my organisations, my own homes and my realty customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He assisted me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again. He is truthful, trustworthy, and reasonable on rate. It's hard to find a sincere AC guy and I'm happy I found Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>

They are also installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER.

They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an alternative for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heaters were not working, integrity Energy was quick to respond. They showed up the next day and replaced two furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the new furnaces can heat your house. Honestly, our house heater is complicated, Rob and his team fixed the old duct, changed all the dampers, make the whole system work completely.<p>
