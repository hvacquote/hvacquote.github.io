<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or lab environments, instead of industrial or outside settings. In tasks where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the building. It might also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to private spaces.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into houses through dirt floors, fractures in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains pipes, and sumps. Direct exposure to radon ends up being a concern when radon becomes trapped in concentrations and structures build up indoors.<p>

<h3>Stop Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water at Spring Valley CA</h3>
<p>Area Ventilation. Outside exhaust fans ought to be installed in all bathrooms and kitchens. These fans remove humidity and carbon monoxide gas. The most reliable fans are durable and quiet. Use fans that run at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans geared up with timers or de-humidistat controls are useful to ensure the fans run for a sufficient period of time. An excellent guideline is to run a restroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
