<p>Excellent Product! Shipment was type of strange being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all intact. The item was extremely lite weight and takes some time to use. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we dealt with concerns. I would recommend this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
<p>Specific kinds of HVAC systems are a little bit more costly than wall systems, ceiling or cassette units are nicely hidden inside the ceiling in the classroom and are for that reason more discreet and visually pleasing to look at. They offer powerful airflow and are considerably more effective than standard wall systems and can, for that reason, reduce the number of systems required and this can lower installation and or replacement costs where multiple HVAC units are needed. Ducted commercial-grade cooling systems are BETTER for the educational environment. They are usually the most expensive option; however, they are also the most aesthetically pleasing as the duct-work and internal units concealed with minimal visibility.<p>
