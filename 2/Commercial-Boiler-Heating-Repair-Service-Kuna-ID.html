<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for assessment and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Airflow patterns in building are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts.

Even if the opening is little, air will move until the inside pressure is equal to the outside.<p>
