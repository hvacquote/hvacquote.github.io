<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
