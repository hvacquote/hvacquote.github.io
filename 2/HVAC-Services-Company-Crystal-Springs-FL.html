<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the visit. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search verified WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was very pleased they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>

I myself was also in the service call service several years ago and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running.

<p>The predominant health result connected with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
