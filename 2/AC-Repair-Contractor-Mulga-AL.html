<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from usage.

Heating systems that kick on often may be because of a filthy filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>

Encourage your kids to play in sand and grassy areas instead of dirt which stays with toys and fingers. Attempt to keep your kids from eating dirt, and ensure they clean their hands when they come within.<p>
