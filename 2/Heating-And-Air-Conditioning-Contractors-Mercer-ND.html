<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to look out for. First, you must check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
