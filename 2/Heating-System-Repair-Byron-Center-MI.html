If you've checked the air in your home and found a radon issue, and you have a well, contact a lab licensed to determine radiation in water to have your water tested.

<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>

Other factors such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can likewise affect how individuals react to the indoor environment.<p>

And due to the fact that each indoor unit has its own thermostat, you can bid farewell to thermostat warfare when a single person would prefer it a little warmer in a different room.<p>
