<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed.

Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
