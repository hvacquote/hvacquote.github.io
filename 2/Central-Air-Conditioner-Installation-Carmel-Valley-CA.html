<p>Professional heating system setups. However, even the best-maintained heating system will ultimately fail. HVAC specialists recommend following this fundamental rule when deciding whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the price of a brand-new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than essential.<p>
<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall.

Ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions since they do not need any new ductwork to be set up. Because a system is installed in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
