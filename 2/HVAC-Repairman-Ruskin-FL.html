<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas gets in homes through dirt floorings, cracks in concrete walls and floors, floor drains pipes, and sumps. When radon becomes trapped in structures and concentrations build up indoors, exposure to radon becomes an issue.<p>
