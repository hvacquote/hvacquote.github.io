<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very helpful in collecting information on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to temporarily manage the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and provided clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
