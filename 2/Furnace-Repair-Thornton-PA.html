<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>

<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace in Thornton PA?</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was really clear and fast about his inspection, guaranteeing I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter.

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
