<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, as opposed to outdoor or commercial settings. In tasks where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It might likewise consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork links to private spaces.<p>

<p>Considering that the 1980s, producers of HVAC devices have been making an effort to make the systems they make more effective. This was originally driven by increasing energy costs, and has more just recently been driven by increased awareness of ecological issues. Additionally, improvements to the HVAC system performance can also help increase occupant health and efficiency. 21 In the United States, the EPA has imposed tighter restrictions throughout the years. There are a number of methods for making HVAC systems more efficient.<p>

Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
