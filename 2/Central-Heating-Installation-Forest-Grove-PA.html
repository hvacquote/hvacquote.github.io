<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
