<p>A split a/c includes two primary parts - a compressor situated outside and an inside air outlet unit. Unlike a system that requires a series of ductwork networked throughout the ceiling, divided ac system count on a set of pipelines to connect the outdoor to the within air unit which is why there are described as a ductless mini-split air conditioning unit installation Refrigerant is distributed through the copper pipes that cycle through the system to generate either heated or cold air.<p>

<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioner works however your house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
