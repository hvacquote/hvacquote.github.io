<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should look out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
