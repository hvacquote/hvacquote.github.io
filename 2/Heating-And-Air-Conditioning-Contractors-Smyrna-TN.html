Typically this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, specifically if the objective of owning a company was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't the end goal. HVAC entrepreneur need to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the same in all other locations.<p>

<p>My eldest child always complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a brand-new one.
