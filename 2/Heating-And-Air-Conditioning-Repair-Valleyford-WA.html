<h3>Floor Heating System in Valleyford WA</h3>
<p>I usually don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>They were excellent! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially requested. They met my requirements entirely by offering a professional quote with choices, without pushing extra products. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and finished a little early. The likewise without delay followed up with the necessary evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>The main reason house owners do not purchase an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the amount of services used. The cost may not be beneficial if the system is new and still under a producer's service warranty. Any significant repairs need to be covered under the maker's guarantee. Nevertheless, some makers require regular maintenance as a term of the service warranty.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the issue, all the while discussing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
