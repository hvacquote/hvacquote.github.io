<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roofing, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an option for property owners to consider. Often times, these units contain not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system individually, considering that the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are generally just available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best option for homeowners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
