<h3>AC And Heating Repair in Peterborough New Hampshire</h3>
<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally unusual now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>

<p>Since they eliminate moisture from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a normally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To handle condensate problems, please see A/c unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
