<p>We take a look at hints before we supply recommendations to change rather than repair a heating system. Among the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy bills are higher year after year, we understand the system is not running effectively. It may be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be squandering cash by not replacing the older system.<p>

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the like geothermal energy though, and the two should not be puzzled.

The two operations use different processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated to boiling point to accomplish its aims.<p>
