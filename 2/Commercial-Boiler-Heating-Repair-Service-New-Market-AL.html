<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were preferred in the first half of the 20th century, specifically in commercial buildings, apartment and large residences. Many steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago stay operable, since the absence of moving parts makes them less vulnerable to use and tear. A steam boiler replacement costs between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it very quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the production of an aerosol result, a lot of commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which may go into close-by ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outside water fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
