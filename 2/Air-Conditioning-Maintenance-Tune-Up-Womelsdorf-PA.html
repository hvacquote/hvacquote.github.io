<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like prolonged car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to correctly service and the system has been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, supplies more details on air-cleaning gadgets to lower indoor air pollutants.<p>
