This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical material gradually.

Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
