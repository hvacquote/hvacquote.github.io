<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller house, which will affect installation costs. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other elements that can impact this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
