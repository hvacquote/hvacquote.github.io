<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you must examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
