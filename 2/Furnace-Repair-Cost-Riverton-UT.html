Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source.

Leaky return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor devices through codes, and after stronger standards are set there is an opportunity to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Airborne irritants are merely a fact of life. Molds can trigger flare-ups of allergy symptoms, and in some cases, trigger asthma attacks. Bacteria, germs, and viruses also can live in the air you breathe every day. These airborne toxins can affect your home comfort devices, too. Allowed to distribute through your home and your system, these and other particles can develop on the indoor coil, inhibiting airflow and lowering heating and cooling effectiveness. By making use of the product or services we provide, you can minimize and often get rid of these undesirable air-borne contaminants from your home, leaving clean air and safe surfaces throughout your home.<p>
<p>Some biological pollutants trigger allergies, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some types of asthma. Infectious health problems, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are sent through the air. Mildews and molds release disease-causing contaminants. Signs of health problems brought on by biological contaminants consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, lethargy, fever, and gastrointestinal issues.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, but it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more residents there are in a room or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have an unfavorable effect on residents-- outside air needs to be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
