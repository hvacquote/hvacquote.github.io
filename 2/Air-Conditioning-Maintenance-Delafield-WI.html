<p>We got in touch with Elite HEATING AND COOLING on one of the most popular days of summertime( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out very same day to examine situation & chose to opt for them for the work. I more than happy to state that not just did we get the central air going however likewise replaced the heating unit which was old. Everybody we talked with from beginning to end were very expert, polite and the work was really effectively done. I would highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>Before you go out and buy an air conditioning unit, there are a couple of things to choose first. Where are you going to be installing the a/c unit? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you wish to install some or go ductless? How large should the a/c be? Too large and you'll encounter problems with short-cycling, which can harm the ac system and reduce its life. Too little and your air conditioner will not be able to cool the house properly. These are just a few of the elements that you require to take into consideration when shopping for a new AC system. Each choice can and will significantly affect your system's performance, which is why you can't afford to disregard any of them.<p>

The technician who explained our alternatives did an excellent task in ensuring we comprehended the advantages and disadvantages of each option.
