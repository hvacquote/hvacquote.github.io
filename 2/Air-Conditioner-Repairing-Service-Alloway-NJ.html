<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside unit as close to the house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>Legionella is a parasite of protozoans such as amoeba, and hence requires conditions ideal for both organisms. The germs forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, consisting of chlorine. Removal for Legionella outbreaks in commercial structures differ, however frequently consist of really warm water flushes (160 ° F; 70 ° C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, and in many cases flushes of heavy metal salts. Preventive measures consist of changing regular hot water levels to allow for 120 ° F( 50 ° C )at the tap, evaluating facility design layout, getting rid of faucet aerators, and periodic screening in suspect locations.<p>
