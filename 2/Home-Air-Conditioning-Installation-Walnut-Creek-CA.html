<h3>Gas Central Heating in Walnut Creek CA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>

These are just a few of the factors that you require to take into consideration when purchasing a new AC system. Each choice can and will significantly impact your system's performance, which is why you can't manage to disregard any of them.<p>
