The majority of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to properly service and the unit has actually been running issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
