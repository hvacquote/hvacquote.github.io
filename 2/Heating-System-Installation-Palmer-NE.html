<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioning unit into a heatpump While space cooling provides optimum versatility, when used to cool numerous rooms at a time it is usually more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
