<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical product in time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
