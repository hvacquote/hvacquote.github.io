More recent gas boilers should achieve 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers should achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the new part.
