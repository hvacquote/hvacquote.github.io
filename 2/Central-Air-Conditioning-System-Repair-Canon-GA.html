<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>An Overview of Central Heating Systems at Canon GA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here).

So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.

<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
