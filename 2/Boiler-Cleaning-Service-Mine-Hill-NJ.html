<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
