<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not provide car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash can be found in monthly, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year.
