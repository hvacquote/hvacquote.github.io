<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply eight to ten years old, it could suck up to twice the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to offer a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER.
