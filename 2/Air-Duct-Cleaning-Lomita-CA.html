<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood just what the problem was and fixed it extremely quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<h3>Central Air Conditioner Installation in Lomita CA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products including carpet underpadding. Opportunities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered.
