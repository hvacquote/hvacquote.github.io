<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies.

<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
