<p>You're most likely hearing the fan motor trying to begin without the boost it requires from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can often conclude that the capacitor has actually stopped working.

<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the objective of owning a business was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it took to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't the end goal. HVAC company owner must pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the exact same in all other areas.<p>
