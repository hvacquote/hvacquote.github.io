<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- give All Vovo a call!

<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor unit as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
