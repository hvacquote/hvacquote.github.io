<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace service technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Heat Exchanger Replacement: â $ " Â The heat exchanger is at the really core of the furnace. Replacing one indicates dismantling the majority of the furnace, changing the part, and reassembling the furnace.

If you replace a furnace due to a bad heat exchanger, consider anÂ Amana, Goodman or Daikin because they have the very best heat exchanger service warranties in the industry on their top heaters.<p>

<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC.
