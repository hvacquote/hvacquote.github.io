<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
