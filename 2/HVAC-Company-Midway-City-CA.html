Initially, use exterior-grade pushed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, cabinets, and wall surface areas. Or, as an option, consider utilizing strong wood products. Second of all, if you plan to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, ensure that an efficient wetness barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet.
