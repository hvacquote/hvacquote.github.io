<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, implying they use air to exchange heat, in the same way as an automobile radiator or normal family air conditioning unit does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outdoors air.<p>
