<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor system instead of ducting air straight from the outside system.

<p>I highly suggest utilizing this service. Very trustworthy exceptionally nice. Looked after a part that was not covered under warranty quick and effective and did not have to pay an arm and a leg to get it done.

I am currently on the maintance strategy. He looks after it two times a year with out having to be advised to do it.<p>
