<p>How climate change impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built.

<p>A geothermal heater is more trusted than alternatives, and is not impacted by any external aspects, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power. For example, wind energy can just be used when there is wind, while solar energy depends on regular sunlight to work efficiently. Geothermal heating depends on neither the sun nor the wind, however instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a offered and trusted  source of energy.<p>
