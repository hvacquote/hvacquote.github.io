<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Wyanet IL</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing pattern in house building is to reduce air leakage through fractures and other openings in walls, floors, and roofs. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor impurities and assists exhaust them from the home.<p>

For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the highest concentrations inside structures are normally near the ceiling. Alternatively, ozone is heavier than air and stays near the floor.<p>
