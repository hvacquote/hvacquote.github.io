<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously if you buy a new gas range or variety. Never use a gas range to heat your home. Always ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in use.<p>
