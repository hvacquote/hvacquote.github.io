For instance, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was extremely thorough and on-time in explaining what services would be carried out. Also Camryn offered terrific customer support at the end of the visit by discussing exactly what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater.
