<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
