<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same. As soon as the electrical wiring is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Do not put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly treat and harden-- typically two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
