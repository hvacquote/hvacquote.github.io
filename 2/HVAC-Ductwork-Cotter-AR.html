<p>Central air is a high-end not everybody can pay for, so many Seattleites must find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in big box stores like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring screens. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to deal with the truth of a terrible, vicious summer season.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, providing warm air to individual bed rooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
