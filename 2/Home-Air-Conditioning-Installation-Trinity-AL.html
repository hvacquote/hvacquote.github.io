A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
