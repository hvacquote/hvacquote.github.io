These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>A bioaerosol is an airborne product of a biological pollutant. Biological impurities in the home might consist of mold, germs, viruses, mites, and pollen. Bioaerosols launched into the air can be distributed throughout the home by the HVAC system. Bioaerosols can trigger contagious illness such as Legionnaires' disease.
