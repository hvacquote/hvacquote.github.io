As a result your oil or natural gas furnace may run longer to supply the same quantity of heat. This will trigger your energy costs to go up. And, all of the cash you pay your energy utility companies every month might be utilized to help you spend for a brand-new, a lot more energy-efficient and energy conserving furnace.
