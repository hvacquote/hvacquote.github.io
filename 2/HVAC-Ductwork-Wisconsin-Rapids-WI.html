<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
