<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a hard job that the employees sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps guys working. When a sales male comes to your house he is there to sell, that is the only method he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and need to not "require" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I offer you the options for your needs and you choose if you require it.<p>

<p>Chemical contaminants: Unstable organic substances ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are various, differed, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally happening chemical substances. Chemical toxins can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products used in the building (e.g., workplace devices; flooring, wall and furnishings coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer products) accidental spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>PE firms tend to operate with the goal of selling or spinning off a firm eventually. This might be through a public offering, a sale to a big business in the field, and even a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management. Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, previously this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for three years prior to that.<p>
<p>Practically half of Americans use air fresheners a minimum of as soon as a week, and 34 percent usage candles or incense that regularly, our nationally representative survey found. Approximately 40 percent rarely or never clean their humidifier or cooking area range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have actually never cleaned or changed their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
