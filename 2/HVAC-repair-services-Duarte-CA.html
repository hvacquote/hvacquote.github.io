<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the exact same. When the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly treat and solidify-- typically two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
