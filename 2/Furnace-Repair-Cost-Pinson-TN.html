<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either since of visible development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

Packaged air conditioning system frequently include electric heating coils or a gas furnace. This mix of a/c unit and central heating unit eliminates the requirement for a separate furnace inside.<p>
