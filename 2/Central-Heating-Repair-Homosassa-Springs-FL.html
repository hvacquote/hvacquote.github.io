<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that ideal temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those typical air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to costly repairs down the road. So, be sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service plan which generally includes a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical material in time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
