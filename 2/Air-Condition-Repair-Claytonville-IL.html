Presently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) requirements however it does provide guidelines about the most typical IAQ office grievances.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Decreasing pollutant concentration by utilizing cleaner (outdoor) air to dilute contaminated (indoor) air. Local building regulations likely specify the quantity (and sometimes quality) of outdoor air that should be constantly provided in your structures, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA).

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
