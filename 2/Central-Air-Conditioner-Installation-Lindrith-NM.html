So maybe a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

<h3>Indoor Air Conditioner in Lindrith NM</h3>
<p>I have been using them for several years for my organisations, my own homes and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. When I called and he encouraged me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again, he assisted me problem shoot the concern. He is honest, trusted, and sensible on price. It's difficult to find a sincere AC person and I'm delighted I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>My eldest kid constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think about anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is itâ and low $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>
