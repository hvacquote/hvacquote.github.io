<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off toxins.)

Packaged units are fantastic for those looking to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system independently, considering that the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally just offered for larger houses due to their high power and capability.
