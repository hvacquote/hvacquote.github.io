<p>I typically do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
