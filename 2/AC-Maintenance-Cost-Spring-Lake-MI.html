<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely handy in gathering details on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to momentarily handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and offered clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.
