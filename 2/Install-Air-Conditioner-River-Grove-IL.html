<p>A car's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being filthy and old. The old coolant will negatively affect the system's performance. To make certain the system is working successfully, think about having a regular coolant system flush. A coolant flush is basic maintenance for your vehicle's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Car Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
