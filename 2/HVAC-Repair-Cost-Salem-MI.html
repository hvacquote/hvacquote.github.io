<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a reference later). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
