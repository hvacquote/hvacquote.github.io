<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a distribution system. Metal pipes are hardly ever used due to long-term destructive concerns. Virtually all hydronic glowing flooring heat systems today utilize 1/2 inch size plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is highly flexible, won't rust and comes in long lengths, which allow PEX pipeline to be woven with very little or no joints.<p>
<p>In Akron 2019 figures, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported an average wage of $21.89 per hour for HVAC service technicians, or $45,540 each year based upon 40-hour weeks. The total salary variety is wide, with the lowest-paid 10 percent of HVAC technicians making $12.89 per hour or less, and the highest-paid 10 percent earning $33.10 per hour or more. Annualized earnings range from under $26,810 to over $68,840 annually, with the typical falling at $43,380. Real-world earnings can be higher, if the technician works substantial overtime.<p>
