<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not offer them.. Secondly like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found someone to correctly service and the system has actually been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
