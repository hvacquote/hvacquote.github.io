<h3>HVAC Repair in Levasy Missouri</h3>
<p>If you think a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>Both must be kept tidy due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
