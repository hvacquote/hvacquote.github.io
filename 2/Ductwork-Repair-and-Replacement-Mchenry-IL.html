<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
