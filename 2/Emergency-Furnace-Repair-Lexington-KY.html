<h3>The Way to Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Lexington KY</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
