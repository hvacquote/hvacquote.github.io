Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
