<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO preserve the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'reliable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

However, assuming they are set up correctly and properly taken care of, the possibility of them having problems is small.<p>
