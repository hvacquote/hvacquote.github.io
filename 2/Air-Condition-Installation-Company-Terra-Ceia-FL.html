<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from inside your home and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
