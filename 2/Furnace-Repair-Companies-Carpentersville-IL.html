And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset.

With time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
