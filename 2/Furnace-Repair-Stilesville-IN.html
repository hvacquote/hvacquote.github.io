<p>Occupational direct exposure limitations use dose-response information which show the health results of repeated direct exposure to one specific chemical. Similar data is not readily available for long-lasting, low-level exposures to a combination of contaminants as is the case for IAQ issues. Currently, there is not enough information offered to forecast the results of exposure to several potentially damaging agents at the very same time.<p>
