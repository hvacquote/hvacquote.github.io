Second of all like prolonged auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat clients relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
