<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heater, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
