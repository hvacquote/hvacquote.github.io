<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
