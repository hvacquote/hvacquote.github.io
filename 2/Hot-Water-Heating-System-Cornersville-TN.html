<p>Because it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your house via ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively uncomplicated procedure. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather expensive if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>

<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website.

I myself was also in the service call company several years back and understand the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year.
