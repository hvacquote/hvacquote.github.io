<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Open windows or use exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common approach of decreasing exposure to indoor air toxins, also will decrease however not eliminate direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Natural or mechanical ventilation methods do not eliminate them from the air in your home as quickly as they develop up due to the fact that smoking cigarettes produces such large quantities of contaminants. In addition, the large increases in ventilation it requires to significantly minimize direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can also increase energy expenses significantly. Subsequently, the most efficient way to decrease direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the house is to eliminate smoking cigarettes there.<p>
