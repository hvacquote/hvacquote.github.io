Buildings constantly progress as an outcome of the changes in the environment around them along with the residents, materials, and activities within them. The different surfaces and the air inside a building are continuously connecting, and this interaction results in changes in each.

In fact, the dirt" we see may be developing as a result of the interactions amongst the moisture, chemicals, and biological materials found there.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area. All items in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature after the convected heat system has been running for a while, consisting of individuals. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts and that sudden shot of coolness when it turns off.<p>

Momentarily increasing ventilation paired with proper use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be beneficial in watering down the concentration of noxious fumes in the air.<p>
