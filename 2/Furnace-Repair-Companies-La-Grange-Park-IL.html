<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your house will not warm up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
