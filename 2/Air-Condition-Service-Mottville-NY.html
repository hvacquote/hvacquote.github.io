<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
