<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power must not go beyond the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to expect much better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, considering that the total capacity of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Basically, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that some of the rooms may not have an extremely comfy temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not easy, given that it takes into consideration not just the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues.

Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
