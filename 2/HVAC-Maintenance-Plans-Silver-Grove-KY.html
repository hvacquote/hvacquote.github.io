<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to offer your home that ideal temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those typical air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can result in expensive repairs down the road. So, make certain to change your AC filters routinely, or get an air conditioning service strategy which normally consists of a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>

In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, possibilities are there will be mold growing nearby. Fix the wetness issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely tidy the location using established health department suggestions.<p>
