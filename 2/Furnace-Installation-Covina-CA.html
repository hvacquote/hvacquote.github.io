<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Issues in Covina CA</h3>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a reference in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
