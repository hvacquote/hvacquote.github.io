<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. A large-scale compressor also costs more to run since it merely takes more electrical energy to run a larger system. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it turns off prior to it has a possibility to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In truth, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
