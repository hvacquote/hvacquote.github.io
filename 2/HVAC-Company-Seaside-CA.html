<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as just radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, occasionally connected to terminal systems like baseboard heating systems. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the approach is described as radiant heating.<p>
