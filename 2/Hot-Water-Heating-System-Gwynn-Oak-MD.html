<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the exact same. When the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly cure and solidify-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
