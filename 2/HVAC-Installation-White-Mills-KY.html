<p>A specialized air conditioner that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioning system because both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the exact same air course. A standard air conditioner transfers heat out of the room due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside. Nevertheless, considering that all parts of the dehumidifier are in the very same space, no heat is eliminated. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is in fact heated up, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
