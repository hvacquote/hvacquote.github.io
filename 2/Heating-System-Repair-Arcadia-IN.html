<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
