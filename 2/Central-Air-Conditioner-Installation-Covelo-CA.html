<p>If your air conditioning system is more than eight years of ages, repair is most likely not worth the expenditure, unless it's a basic issue like particles blocking the condenser system or a worn fan belt. Still, to finest weigh your repair-or-replace choice, ask your contractor to examine not simply the condition of your existing equipment, but likewise the ducts that deliver the cool air and the overall quality of the insulation in your house.
