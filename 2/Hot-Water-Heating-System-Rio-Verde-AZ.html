Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated procedure. Installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather pricey if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
