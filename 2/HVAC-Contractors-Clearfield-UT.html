<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Essential Company in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are rated 90% efficiency or much better; it is not uncommon for a contemporary furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older designs, which may be rated as low as 80% efficiency, this can mean significant savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase efficiency even further by running at lower or greater capacity depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>

This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location. All things in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the radiant heat system has been running for a while, including people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace begins and that abrupt shot of coolness when it turns off.<p>

Dripping return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
