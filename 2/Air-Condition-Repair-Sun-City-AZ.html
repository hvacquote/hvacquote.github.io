<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a referral later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
