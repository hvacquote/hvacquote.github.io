<p>I am replacing our High Speed System since of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have an alternative for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>If the AC does not switch off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not emit heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place gradually since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to work until you buy a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is typically essential to determining the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such details can sometimes be acquired by requesting copies of air monitoring information from the employer. If keeping track of information is not offered, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union representative should request that the employer have air tracking tests carried out. Evaluation of this information might identify potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. However, when contaminant concentrations are very low, monitoring information may not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
