<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
