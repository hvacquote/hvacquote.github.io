<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
