<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should briefly switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
