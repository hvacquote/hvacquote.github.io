They are likewise setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER.

<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit contaminants.)

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
