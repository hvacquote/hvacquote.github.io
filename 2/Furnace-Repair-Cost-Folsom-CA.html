<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heaters are still extensively used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>It is particularly essential to take as many of these steps as possible while you are involved in short-term activities that can generate high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint removing, heating with kerosene heaters, cooking, or participating in maintenance and hobby activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding.
