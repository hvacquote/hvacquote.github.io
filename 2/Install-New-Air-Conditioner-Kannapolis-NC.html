Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step.

<h3>Truth About Kannapolis NC Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing Waychoff for about ten years. Initially, they repaired a bad installation from a previous company. Afterwards, they have actually kept my system semi-annually. Their techs are expert and extremely well-informed. Expenses are affordable. Always on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff set up a new air handler and condenser today. I did not trouble to get rival's quotes since of my trust in Waychoff since the cost was clearly affordable.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
