<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're probably hearing the fan motor attempting to begin without the boost it requires from the capacitor. You can usually conclude that the capacitor has failed. Often you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille.

<p>A geothermal heating system is more trusted than options, and is not affected by any external aspects, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power. For instance, wind energy can just be used when there is wind, while solar power depends on regular sunshine to work effectively.

This makes geothermal heating a reliable and available source of energy.<p>
