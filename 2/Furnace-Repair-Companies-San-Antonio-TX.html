<h3>Facts All Homeowners Must Know About HVAC Installation in San Antonio TX</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was required and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the hot water heater due to the fact that the technicians thought they simply didn't seem right and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
