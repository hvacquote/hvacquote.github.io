It likewise prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage.
