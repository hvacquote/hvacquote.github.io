<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
