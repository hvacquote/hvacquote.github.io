<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil modification in your vehicle. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter better traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star recommends changing your filter when every three months. Throughout high use months, examine the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
