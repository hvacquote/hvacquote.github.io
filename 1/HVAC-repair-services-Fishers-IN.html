<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summertime a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. If items with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
