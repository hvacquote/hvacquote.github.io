It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not just with newbies more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are finally giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>

He knew simply what the problem was and fixed it very rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
