<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in monthly, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
