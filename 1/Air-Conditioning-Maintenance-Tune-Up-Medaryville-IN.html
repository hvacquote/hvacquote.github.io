<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>The installation was fast, professional and effectively done. The installers were courteous and knew precisely what to do.

I very highly suggest the two gentlemen as they are outstanding at what they do. Thank you to them as they certainly deserve my thanks and gratitude for a job well done.<p>
