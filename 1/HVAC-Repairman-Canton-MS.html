Secondly, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, make certain that a reliable moisture barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet.

<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the visit. They recommended changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was extremely pleased they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>
