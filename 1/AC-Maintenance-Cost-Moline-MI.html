<h2>How To Hire HVAC Services in Moline</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the conventional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the standard hot water heater can be turned off totally.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
