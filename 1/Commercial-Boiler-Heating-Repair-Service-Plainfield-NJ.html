<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things initially. Make sure all the signs up in your home are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
