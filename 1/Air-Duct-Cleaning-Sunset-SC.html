<h3>Repair and Care for Sunset SC Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely delighted that someone as experienced as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to check the a/c unit prior to you buy. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had methods to check AC units even in winter season. We want we had actually known him then.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be inhaled.
