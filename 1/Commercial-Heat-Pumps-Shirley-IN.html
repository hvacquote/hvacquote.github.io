<p>The very first air conditioning system and fridges used flammable or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could result in deadly accidents when they dripped.

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
