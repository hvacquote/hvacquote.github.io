<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
