Indoor air contamination is one danger that you can do something about.<p>
<p>Because an a/c unit moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both should be kept clean. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
