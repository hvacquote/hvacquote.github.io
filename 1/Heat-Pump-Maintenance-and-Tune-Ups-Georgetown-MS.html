<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour.
