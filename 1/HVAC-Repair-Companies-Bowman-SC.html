<p>When our furnace was passing away, we contacted two local companies for quotes. While both were handy and useful, Ballard Natural Gas provided us a much better offer, for extraordinary service. Instead of a simple sales task, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heating unit and located ways we could have more even heat. He included these small but considerable adjustments in his bid. Since of recent warmer summers and for ecological reasons, we decided to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
