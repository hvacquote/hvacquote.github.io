<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 must be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors may also be required.<p>
<p>Air toxins can vary from pollutants generated from the outdoors by your pets to dangerous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air toxin resulting from natural gas that gets away into your house without being burned off. Older homes may include asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In kitchens and restrooms, mold and mildew can end up being an annoyance where wetness levels are generally greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, but it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level. The more residents there remain in a space or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too expensive-- which can have a negative influence on occupants-- outside air needs to be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
