<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Smyrna MI</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by improving airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be correctly vented and cleaned from the furnace regularly. Change the filters occasionally and have your ductwork cleaned due to the fact that the soot develops inside the ducts, lowering their performance gradually. Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
