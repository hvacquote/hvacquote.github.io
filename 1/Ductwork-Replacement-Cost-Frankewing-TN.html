<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Great Item! Shipment was sort of weird being that package was opened and items might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we resolved concerns. I would suggest this product to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company used 98% of the existing product purchased with your home. This company introduced a service agreement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and pipes. Throughout the assessment on an extremely cold day they killed the furnace declaring health risk reason and contractor laws for their choice. As a brand-new resident I have found out how to identify the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
