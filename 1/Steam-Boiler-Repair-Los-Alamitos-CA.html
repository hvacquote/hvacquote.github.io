<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more difficult to manage than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans use air fresheners a minimum of as soon as a week, and 34 percent usage candle lights or incense that regularly, our nationally representative study found. Approximately 40 percent seldom or never clean their humidifier or kitchen area range hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have actually never ever cleaned up or replaced their furnace filter. And nearly 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can intensify indoor air quality.<p>
