<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, much of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
