According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same toxins.

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.
