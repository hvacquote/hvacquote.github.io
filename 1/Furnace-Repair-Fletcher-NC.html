<h3>Ventilation Double Flux in Fletcher NC</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was really practical in collecting info on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to briefly deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and offered clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
