<p>Both need to be kept tidy because an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually result in harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<h3>Air Filter Replacement in Smithfield NC</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was really helpful in collecting details on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to briefly cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and offered clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely use Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
