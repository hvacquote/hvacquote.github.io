<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, since it is secured indoors. When it does require to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical standards eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever.

Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
