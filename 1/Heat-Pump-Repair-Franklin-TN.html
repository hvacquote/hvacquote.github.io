<p>Though it might be difficult to believe, the air inside your house can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are infamous for lowering the air quality in your house, however there are numerous other contaminants that can not only filthy up the air, but lead to other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and building materials add to poor air quality, and can likewise trigger cancers. VOCs (volatile organic substances) from paint and even from some sort of carpets and upholstery products can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur over time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you need to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
