<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
