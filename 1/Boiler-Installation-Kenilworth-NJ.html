<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the visit. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the go to or the brand-new part. I was very pleased they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will certainly be utilizing them again.<p>
