<p>Professional heater installations. However, even the best-maintained heating system will ultimately fail. HVAC experts recommend following this basic rule when deciding whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a new system, it's best to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate great but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
