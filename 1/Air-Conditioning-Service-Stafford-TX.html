<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it really rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical product with time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
