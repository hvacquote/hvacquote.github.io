<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it might flatter two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to provide a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed just a couple of years back.<p>

Radiant heating systems can also heat rooms with less energy invested, and keep them warmed for longer, given that many floors tend to retain heat much better than air does.<p>
