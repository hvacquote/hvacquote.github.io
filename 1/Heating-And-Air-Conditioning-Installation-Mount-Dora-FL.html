<p>Sean was very useful. He is a really pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase extra stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>

For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by lots of people.<p>
