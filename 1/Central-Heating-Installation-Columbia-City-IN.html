<p>A packaged unit, normally installed on the roofing, is most frequently used on commercial structures, but it is also a choice for homeowners to think about. Many times, these units consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those wanting to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system separately, considering that the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are normally just readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a good way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best alternative for property owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
