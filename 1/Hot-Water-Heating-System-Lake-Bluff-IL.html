<h3>Furnace Repair in Lake Bluff Illinois</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a fast web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was really pleased they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>

Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.<p>
