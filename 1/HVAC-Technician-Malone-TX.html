It likewise prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
