Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature level, and then switch it ON. To prevent straining an ac system's compressor, wait at least five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>

<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
