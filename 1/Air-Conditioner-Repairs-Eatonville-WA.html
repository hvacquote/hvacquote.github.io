<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
