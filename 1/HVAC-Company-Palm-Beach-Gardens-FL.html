<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have built-in delay features. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
