The majority of home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window air conditioning unit with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors remove impurities directly from the space where the fan is located and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
