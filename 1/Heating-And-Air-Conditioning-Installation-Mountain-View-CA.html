<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
