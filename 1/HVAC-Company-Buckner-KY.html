Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
