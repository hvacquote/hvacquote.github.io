<p>3. Gas Heating systems While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is usually higher than many heat pump choices, they can still be extremely efficient, depending upon the design you purchase.

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
