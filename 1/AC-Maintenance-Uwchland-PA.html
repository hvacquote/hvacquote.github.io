<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
