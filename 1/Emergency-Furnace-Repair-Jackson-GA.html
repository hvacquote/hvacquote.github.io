<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost great but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
