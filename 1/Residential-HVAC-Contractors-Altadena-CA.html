<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise apartment or condos bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has enjoyed the single-family home installation organisation entirely flip on its head the last couple of years. Winter utilized to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to approximately 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not just with beginners more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are finally giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system. Because it just takes more electrical power to run a larger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the room can feel clammy and wet.<p>
