PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heatpump While space air conditioning offers optimum flexibility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is usually more expensive than central air.<p>
