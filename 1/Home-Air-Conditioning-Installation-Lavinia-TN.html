However then recognized ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>

This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise required to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
