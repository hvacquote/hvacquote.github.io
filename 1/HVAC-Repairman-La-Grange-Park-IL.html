<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical product over time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
