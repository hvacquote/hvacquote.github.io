<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The function of many building ventilation systems is to generate appropriate fresh air for resident comfort while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building security at affordable energy costs. Load determining is described as the Handbook J estimation and need to be carried out by the HVAC contractor before offering an installation or unit cost for cooling. If your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning system you need based upon experience or on square video footage alone, move to another contractor.

<p>Reality: Federal and local rewards usually amount to in between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can often make the initial rate of a system competitive with standard equipment.

Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. Nevertheless, new installation practices are decreasing costs, to the point where the cost is getting closer to conventional systems under the right conditions.<p>
