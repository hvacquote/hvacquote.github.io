<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Needham IN</h3>
<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor.
