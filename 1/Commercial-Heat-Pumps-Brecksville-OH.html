<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions.

Protexs deal was one of the couple of reasonable ones received. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex properly advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install group was respectful of my house and installed the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post install inspection outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality.

Dust and dander are well-known for lowering the air quality in your house, however there are lots of other contaminants that can not only dirty up the air, but cause other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and building materials add to poor air quality, and can also cause cancers.

More than one case has actually involved outside water fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to acquire infection.<p>
