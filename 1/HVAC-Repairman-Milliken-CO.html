<h3>Installation of HVAC in Milliken CO</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

High-efficiency designs cost more, but save more over the long haul. Costs for gas furnaces range from $1,360 for the low-efficiency models approximately $12,500 for high-efficiency models. Electric heating systems start at $395 and vary up to $1,700 or more depending upon the brand name and furnace size.<p>
