<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to correctly service and the system has been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
