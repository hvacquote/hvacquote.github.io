<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Dallas NC Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We picked getting something more expensive than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
