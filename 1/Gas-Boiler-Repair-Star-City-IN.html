Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2).

Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
