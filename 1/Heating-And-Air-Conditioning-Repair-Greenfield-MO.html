<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, schools and workplaces matters, particularly because we invest the majority of our lives inside. Air conditioning system assist to dehumidify the inbound air, but in incredibly humid environments or in cases where the a/c unit is oversized, it may not accomplish a low humidity.

<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
