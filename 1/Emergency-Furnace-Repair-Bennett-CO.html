<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).

<h3>Appropriate Things To Consider In Your Bennett CO Commercial HVAC Service Provider</h3>
<p>I have actually been using Waychoff for about ten years. Initially, they fixed a bad installation from a previous company. Afterwards, they have actually maintained my system semi-annually. Their techs are professional and very experienced. Expenses are affordable. Always on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff installed a brand-new air handler and condenser today. I did not trouble to get rival's quotes since of my trust in Waychoff because the cost was undoubtedly sensible.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in vehicles in the U.S. till 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, however is still imported and can be purchased and used by licensed HVAC professionals. For systems needing only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by lots of people.<p>
