Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop in between the surface area systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These different heat sources also dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones.

Installing a multi-split system produces more problems, since a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
