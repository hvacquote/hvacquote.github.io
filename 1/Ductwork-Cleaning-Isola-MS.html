<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy performance of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Filters can get filthy quickly, especially if you reside in a location that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all type of dust, debris, germs, and clean the air. They are accountable for preserving the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned up and replaced regularly, your HVAC system will ultimately stop performing as you anticipate it to. The heating & cooling will be inefficient and the indoor air quality will intensify. Examining and changing the air filters is among the most important elements of HVAC maintenance.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a building." Those processes consist of generating outside air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the structure, and moving some part of indoor air outside. If several of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
