<p>I am really amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company several years ago and know the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger.
