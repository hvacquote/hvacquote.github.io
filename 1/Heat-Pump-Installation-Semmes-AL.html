<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most economical. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
