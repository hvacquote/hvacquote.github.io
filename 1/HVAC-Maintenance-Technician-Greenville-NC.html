<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Basics in Greenville NC</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can trigger watery eyes, burning feelings in the eyes and throat, nausea, and problem in breathing in some people exposed at raised levels (above 0.1 parts per million). High concentrations may trigger attacks in individuals with asthma. There is evidence that some individuals can establish a level of sensitivity to formaldehyde. It has actually likewise been revealed to cause cancer in animals and may cause cancer in human beings.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things first. Ensure all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
