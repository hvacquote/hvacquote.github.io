<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the same. When the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively harden and treat-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
