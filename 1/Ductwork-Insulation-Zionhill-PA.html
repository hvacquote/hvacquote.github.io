<h3>Things to Consider When Buying a Heat Pump in Zionhill PA</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely useful. He is a really enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure applied to buy additional things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no issues aside from the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it very quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
