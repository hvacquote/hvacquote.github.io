<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew simply what the issue was and fixed it very quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can pay for, many Seattleites need to find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in huge box stores like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are taken up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring display screens.
