<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not emit heat effectively and will keep the system running.

The 2 operations use different procedures, with geothermal energy needing water be heated to boiling point to achieve its aims.<p>
