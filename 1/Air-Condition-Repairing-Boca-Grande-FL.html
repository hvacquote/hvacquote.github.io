<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that might affect the health of people who reside in the house. Toxins might originate from outside the house-- such as an idling car engine in a connected garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground below. An air pollutant might likewise come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or individual care products. Germs and viruses, pet dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>While contaminants commonly discovered in indoor air are responsible for lots of damaging impacts, there is significant uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of exposure are needed to produce particular health problems.
