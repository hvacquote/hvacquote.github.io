<p>Chemical contaminants: Unstable organic compounds ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are numerous, varied, and common. They include both human-made and naturally taking place chemical substances. Chemical toxins can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from products used in the building (e.g., office equipment; furniture, floor and wall coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer products) accidental spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from inside and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless harmful gas. Since it is impossible to see, smell or taste, CO can kill you before you know it remains in your house. At lower levels of exposure, CO causes moderate impacts that are frequently mistaken for the influenza. These symptoms consist of headaches, dizziness, disorientation, fatigue and nausea. The results of CO direct exposure can vary significantly from person to individual depending on age, total health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
