<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your house will not warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC system is wintry, the evaporator coil is more than likely frozen.

It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the air conditioning system's evaporator coil.<p>

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
