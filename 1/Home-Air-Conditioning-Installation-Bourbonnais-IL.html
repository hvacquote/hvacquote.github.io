<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are likewise referred to as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each room to be changed independently. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the ac system into a heat pump While room cooling supplies optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool many spaces at a time it is usually more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
