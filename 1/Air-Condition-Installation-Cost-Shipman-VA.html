<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC system than a smaller home, which will impact installation costs. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other elements that can affect this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>

The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
