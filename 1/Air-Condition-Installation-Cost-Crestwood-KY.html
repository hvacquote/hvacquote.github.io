After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and redid the whole plenum and the duct for the hot water heater due to the fact that the service technicians believed they simply didn't seem best and they couldn't leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
