<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
