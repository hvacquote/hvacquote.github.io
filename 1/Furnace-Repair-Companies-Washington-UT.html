<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Washington UT</h3>
<p>No one ought to need to deal with the trouble of installing central air on their own. No matter where you are in the installation process, we can assist by responding to any questions that you have, resolving problems that you've been battling with, and thereby making your central air conditioning installation as painless as possible. Call us today, and find just how much easier your central air conditioning installation can be.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
