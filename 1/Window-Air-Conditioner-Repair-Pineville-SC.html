Initially, you must inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
