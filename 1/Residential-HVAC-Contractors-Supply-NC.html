<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Supply NC</h3>
<p>When you and your household walk into your home in Sacramento, CA, are you as comfortable as you can be? Do you find it to be either too cold throughout the winter season or too warm in areas throughout the summer? Whether you're having an issue with uneven cooling or heating, or your indoor air quality isn't up to par, Sierra Pacific Home & Comfort, Inc. has the product or services you need.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
