<p>They were fantastic! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally requested. They fulfilled my needs completely by offering an expert quote with alternatives, without pressing extra items. The crew showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The likewise promptly followed up with the essential examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't offer off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen in time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick up until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
