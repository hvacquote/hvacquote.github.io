<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
