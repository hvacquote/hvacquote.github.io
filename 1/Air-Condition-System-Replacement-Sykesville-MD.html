<p>Recent Review: They were fantastic! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally asked for. They satisfied my requirements entirely by supplying an expert quote with options, without pushing extra items. The crew showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The likewise immediately followed up with the necessary inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service contract attempts to upsell you whenever they pertain to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, despite the fact that it was 6 months before the current one ended. She didn't need a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>
