<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or two. Unscrew the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Image 6).<p>

<h3>Duct Cleaning in Your Delco NC Home</h3>
<p>Your lungs are responsible for bringing fresh air into your body, while all at once eliminating waste gases and particulates. Needless to say, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the harder it is for your lungs to eliminate them. Poor air quality - whether it is inside or outdoors - can make it significantly difficult for your lungs to operate effectively, and can have negative health impacts.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that an air conditioning unit moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both must be kept tidy. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
