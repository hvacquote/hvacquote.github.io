The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air assists and waters down indoor pollutants exhaust them from the home.<p>

At lower levels of direct exposure, CO triggers moderate results that are often mistaken for the influenza. These signs consist of headaches, dizziness, queasiness, disorientation and tiredness. The results of CO exposure can vary greatly from individual to individual depending upon age, general health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
