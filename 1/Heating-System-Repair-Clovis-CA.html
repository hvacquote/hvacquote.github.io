<h3>Furnace Installation in Clovis CA</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment.

When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat.
