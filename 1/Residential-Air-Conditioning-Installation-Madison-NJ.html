<p>Check these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your home are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the registers.
