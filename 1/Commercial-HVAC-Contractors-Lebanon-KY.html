Some individuals can become sensitized to biological or chemical contaminants after repeated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. A ductless system has an integrated performance advantage since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Since they do not need any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Since a system is installed in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you exist.<p>
