Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no issues aside from the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
