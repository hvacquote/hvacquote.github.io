<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like prolonged auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
