Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off.<p>

<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually discovered them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was essential and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the water heater due to the fact that the technicians thought they just didn't seem best and they could not leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>

<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best feature of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers guarantee would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Likewise they detected the issue and repaired really rapidly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as essential when it pertains to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size.
