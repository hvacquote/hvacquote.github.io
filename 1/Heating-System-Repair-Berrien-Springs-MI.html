<p>Open windows or use exhaust fans. Ventilation, a typical approach of decreasing direct exposure to indoor air toxins, also will decrease but not eliminate exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Because cigarette smoking produces such large amounts of pollutants, natural or mechanical ventilation techniques do not remove them from the air in your home as rapidly as they develop. In addition, the large increases in ventilation it takes to substantially reduce exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy expenses considerably. Subsequently, the most effective way to minimize exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the home is to remove smoking cigarettes there.<p>

The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is circulated back into your home.
