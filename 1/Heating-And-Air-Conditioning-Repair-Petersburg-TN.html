Put simply, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that some of the spaces might not have a really comfy temperature level. However, the estimation of the total power is not easy, given that it considers not just the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
