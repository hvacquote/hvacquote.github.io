<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have integrated delay features. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and re-installed the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years earlier and know the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
