<h3>Advantages of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Schuyler VA</h3>
<p>Call Miller's Air Conditioning & Heating at (925) 447-3000 and always talk to a live and handy  member of our team, who will instantly focus on your requirements. While our competitors punch a rigorous time clock, we recognize heating and cooling challenges frequently develop outside of routine business hours.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
