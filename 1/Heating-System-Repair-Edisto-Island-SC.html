<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
