<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a recommendation in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>

<p>I normally do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
