<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
