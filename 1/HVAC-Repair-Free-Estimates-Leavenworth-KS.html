<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Buildings are designed or meant to react actively to some of these modifications in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sterilize, and keep surfaces to enhance their longevity, look, or efficiency. In other cases, such modifications discreetly or even dramatically alter buildings in ways that might be essential to their own integrity or their influence on building occupants through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that specify them at any time. We may discover it beneficial to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, particularly, a few of the methods utilized by researchers studying environments, in order to get an improved understanding of the environments in which we invest most of our time, our buildings.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 should be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements used for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the huge photo" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality display can be set up to offer threshold notifies. If, for example, the outdoors air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could set up your monitoring equipment to alert you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has actually reached crucial point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the appropriate action to fix the situation instantly.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the concept of an in-floor heating system seems less like a high-end product and more like a requirement. (Besides, heated up floorings were excellent enough for the Roman Empire) But prior to you dedicate to what can be a significant renovation job, it's best to ask yourself whether a radiant flooring heating unit is an appropriate service for your specific home heating requirements.<p>
