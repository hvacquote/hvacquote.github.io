<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not use car debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Care Tips in Richland MO</h3>
<p>Each repair we perform is important to us. Our AC technicians are expertly trained, and they continue to pursue continuous education. You'll discover them experienced about your specific AC system. The problem will be diagnosed correctly and the repair performed efficiently. If an unit can't be fixed, we'll give you choices for changing it. Our AC company will make certain the whole procedure goes as smoothly as possible. You'll have the chance to approve a cost and evaluate quote before we begin.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
