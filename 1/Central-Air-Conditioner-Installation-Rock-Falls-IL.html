<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
