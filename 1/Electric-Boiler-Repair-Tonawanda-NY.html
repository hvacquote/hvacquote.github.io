The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a recommendation later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
