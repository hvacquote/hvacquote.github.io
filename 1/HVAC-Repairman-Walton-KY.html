<h3>The Way Central Heating Boilers Keep Your Walton KY Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>Sean was very helpful. He is a really enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase extra stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
