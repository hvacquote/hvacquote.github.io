<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance determine the efficiency of dilution.

There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A common component required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
