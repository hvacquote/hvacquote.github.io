<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me relating to an abnormally high bill that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he understood that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of issue.

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you should look out for. First, you must examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
