<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was fast and really clear about his inspection, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

The lack of moving parts suggests you're less most likely to invest big on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be anticipated to last for 50 years. They're considerably more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
