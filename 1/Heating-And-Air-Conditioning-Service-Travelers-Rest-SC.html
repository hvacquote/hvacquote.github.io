<h3>Facts All Homeowners Should Know About HVAC Installation in Travelers Rest SC</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between a outside and indoor system rather of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
