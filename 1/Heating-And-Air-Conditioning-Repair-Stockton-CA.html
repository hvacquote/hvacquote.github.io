<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
