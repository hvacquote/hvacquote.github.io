<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, class or laboratory environments, rather than outside or industrial settings. In tasks where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>When installing radiant heat, you should offer severe thought to the type of floor covering in the house. Because it carries out and shops heat, ceramic tile works well. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less efficient, however work reasonably well. Carpets will directly insulate the floor from the space, decreasing effectiveness, so if you wish to set up carpet in a radiant-heated space, use a thin carpet with dense cushioning.<p>
