<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema.
