<p>There are two main forms of radiant flooring heating, or RFH as it's understood in the home heating organisation. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the flooring surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are required to withstand current, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
