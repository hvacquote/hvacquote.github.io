<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them.
