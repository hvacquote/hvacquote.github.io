<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you may require a reference in the future).

The female crimp connectors need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
