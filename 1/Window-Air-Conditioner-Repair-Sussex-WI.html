<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment.

Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
