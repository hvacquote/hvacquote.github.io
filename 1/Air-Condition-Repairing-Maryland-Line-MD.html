<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater.
