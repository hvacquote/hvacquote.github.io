<p>In more complex schemes, warm air is allowed to flow and increase out high building openings to the outside (stack result ), causing cool outside air to be drawn into low building openings. Natural ventilation schemes can use very little energy, but care needs to be taken to ensure comfort. In humid or warm environments, keeping thermal comfort exclusively through natural ventilation may not be possible. Cooling systems are utilized, either as backups or supplements.
