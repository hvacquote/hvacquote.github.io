<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance in Whitehouse TX</h3>
<p>The types of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are as different as the different homes they serve (single household houses, duplexes, mobile houses, houses, high-rise condominiums, row housing, etc.). No matter what the kind of home HVAC system, adequate air flow (ventilation), proper filtering, and humidity manage all contribute to a healthy indoor air environment. > Also, regular maintenance of the HVAC system will make sure that it is running securely and not contributing to or causing an indoor air issue.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't offer off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off.
