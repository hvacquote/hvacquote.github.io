<h3>Factors to Consider When Searching for a Good AC Repair Company in Tamassee SC</h3>
<p>The rest of the HVAC system also requires to be in leading condition for the a/c unit to work well. This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which reside inside the house. If the specific parts are in correct order, the technician can analyze the ductwork for signs of holes, gaps or excessive dirt. Sealing leakages in ductwork can improve HVAC effectiveness by as much as 30 percent, and provide for a cooler home in the hot summer season.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
