<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has an integrated performance advantage due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Due to the fact that they don't need any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Due to the fact that an unit is installed in each room or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>

<p>Self-installation tends to develop more problems than it fixes.

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>HVAC coils typically give you a good 15-20 years of life prior to they begin establishing refrigerant leaks. Refrigerant leakages aren't the only issue a/c coils have. Coils, after several years, lose the capability to move heat effectively.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood simply what the issue was and repaired it very quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
