<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC.
