<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
