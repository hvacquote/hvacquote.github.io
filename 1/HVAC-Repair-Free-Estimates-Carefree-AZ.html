<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) is an essential concern in correction centers. It can straight impact the health and convenience of correctional officers and inmates. The United States Epa (EPA) truth sheet An Office complex Occupants Guide to Indoor Air Quality to help worksites address numerous IAQ problems using often inexpensive and practical steps.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>At present, EPA does not advise utilizing air cleaners to lower levels of radon and its decay items. Because they only partially remove the radon decay items and do not decrease the quantity of radon getting in the house, the effectiveness of these gadgets is uncertain. EPA prepares to do additional research study on whether air cleaners are, or might end up being, a reliable means of minimizing the health threat from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, offers further info on air-cleaning devices to minimize indoor air toxins.<p>
