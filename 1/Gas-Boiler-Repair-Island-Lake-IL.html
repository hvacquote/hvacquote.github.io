<p>Specialist heater installations. However, even the best-maintained heating system will ultimately fail. HVAC specialists suggest following this standard guideline when deciding whether it's worth buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a new system, it's finest to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years approximately. Loosen the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Image 6).<p>
