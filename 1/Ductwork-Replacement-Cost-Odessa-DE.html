<p>The primary health impact connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
