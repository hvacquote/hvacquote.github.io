<p>We contacted Elite HVACS on among the most popular days of summer season( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out exact same day to evaluate situation & chose to go with them for the work. I am happy to say that not just did we get the central air going however also replaced the heating system which was old. Everybody we spoke with from starting to end were really professional, considerate and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>Employ specialists and treat them well: Encouraged, well-compensated specialists perform far better work than short-term subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success. An ethical company doesn't make use of low-cost labor chances just because they're inexpensive. Economical craftsmanship is normally shoddy workmanship, and it never helps a company build long-term relationships with clients.<p>

ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
