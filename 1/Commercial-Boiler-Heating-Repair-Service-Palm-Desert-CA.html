<p>I generally don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
<p>. Before selecting the installation place of air conditioner, several main aspects need to be thought about. To start with, the direction of air flow from the indoor units ought to not fall on the location of rest or work area. Second of all, there must not be any obstacles on the way of the air flow that might avoid it from covering the area of the facilities as much as possible. The outside system should also be located in an open area, otherwise the heat from the house will not be efficiently released outdoors and the efficiency of the entire system will drop sharply. It is highly recommended to set up the a/c unit systems in quickly available places, for further maintenance during operation.<p>
