Warm air is provided to the spaces of your house by means of ducts, and cool air is gathered by means of cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for efficiency.

In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the standard heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
