After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness.

In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
