<p>I admit I have not done the math recently, however I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I feel like they offer me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little more for that comfort.<p>
