<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the go to. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a fast internet search validated WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective.
