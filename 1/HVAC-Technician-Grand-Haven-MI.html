So perhaps a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>In houses, the most substantial sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pushed wood items used adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood products produced indoor use consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for decorative wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiber board (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiberboard contains a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood product and is typically recognized as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood item.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy.
