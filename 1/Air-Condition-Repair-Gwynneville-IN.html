<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a recommendation later on). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
