Much like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE rates just how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling impact.
