<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not use car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in monthly, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
