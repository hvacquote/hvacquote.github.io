<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you need to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
