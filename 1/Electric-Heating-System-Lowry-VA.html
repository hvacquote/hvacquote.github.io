<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you need to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
