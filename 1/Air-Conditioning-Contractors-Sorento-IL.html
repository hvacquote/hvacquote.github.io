<p>Firstly, The after hours addressing service representative, John, was extremely respectful and professional. Secondly, Gracion W is a prompt, knowledgeable technician. He was at my house within the time he gave me, repaired the issue while describing the problem then remained a number of minutes to ensure it was working correctly. The concern was fixed in a matter of time that I have actually never ever seen before while being a property owner for ten years. I also suggest one of the Protection Plans, which I belong to, if you like to conserve money. Thank you." Karen P.<p>

<h3>Install Air Conditioner in Sorento IL</h3>
<p>We got in touch with Elite HEATING AND COOLING on one of the most popular days of summertime( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out same day to assess situation & decided to go with them for the work. I enjoy to state that not only did we get the central air going however also changed the heating system which was old. Everyone we spoke with from beginning to end were extremely professional, considerate and the work was extremely effectively done. I would extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely handy in gathering info on the phone and offering clear directions about how to momentarily cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and offered clear interaction about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly utilize Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>

<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service contract attempts to upsell you whenever they pertain to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, even though it was 6 months prior to the current one expired. She didn't require a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
