<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
