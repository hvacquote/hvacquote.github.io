<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will require to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
