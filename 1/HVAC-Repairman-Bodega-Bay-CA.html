<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most heating systems have numerous control boards. The largest, or only one in some heaters, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards collaborate the operation and control of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control panel must be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
