<p>Circuit Board Replacement: Ã¢ $ " Ã Most heating systems have numerous control boards. The largest, or only one in some heaters, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards collaborate the operation and control of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control panel must be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonÃ¢ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnÃ¢ $ t effectively identified, altering a board wonÃ¢ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable as soon as installed. ItÃ¢ $ s smart to leave this repair to a pro to identify.<p>
