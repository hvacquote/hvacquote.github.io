<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even little window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions necessitate. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will require to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
