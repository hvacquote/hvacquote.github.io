<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product in time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
