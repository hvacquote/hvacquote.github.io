<p>Allergens are products that trigger an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can end up being airborne, and therefore, are easily inhaled. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the existence of cat allergen could induce an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergic reactions, however not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical material with time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
