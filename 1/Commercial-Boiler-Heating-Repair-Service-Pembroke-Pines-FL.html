<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace professionals often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>If your central air conditioning conditioner will not cool but you can hear it running, it might just need to be cleaned. Whether this is the reason for the problem, it's a great early remedy to attempt. Plan to do this on a relatively warm day. Never ever utilize a power washer for this-- it can harm the fins. The following are standards; always describe your owner's handbook. Note: Constantly shut off the power before cleaning the system.<p>
