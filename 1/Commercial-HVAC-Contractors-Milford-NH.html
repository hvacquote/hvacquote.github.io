<p>The federal government suggests that houses be weatherized in order to lower the quantity of energy required for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, actions must also be taken to minimize contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.) In addition, homeowners should be alert to the emergence of indications of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development. Additional weatherization measures should not be carried out till these problems have actually been remedied.<p>
<p>Utilize specialists and treat them well: Encouraged, well-compensated specialists perform far better work than short-term subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success.

Economical workmanship is typically inferior craftsmanship, and it never helps a company build long-term relationships with customers.<p>
<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your home's square footage.
