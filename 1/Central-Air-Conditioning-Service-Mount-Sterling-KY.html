<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair in Mount Sterling KY</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes a lot more severe with lower outdoor temperatures, so heatpump are typically installed in tandem with a more conventional kind of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heat pump during harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is utilized effectively during the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
