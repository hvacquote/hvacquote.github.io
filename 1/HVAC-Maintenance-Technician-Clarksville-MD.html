First off, the direction of air circulation from the indoor systems ought to not fall on the place of rest or workspace. Secondly, there must not be any obstacles en route of the airflow that may prevent it from covering the space of the premises as much as possible. The outdoor unit needs to also be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be successfully released outside and the performance of the whole system will drop sharply.
