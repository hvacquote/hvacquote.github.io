<p>AC units and thermostats have integrated delay functions when they're closed down and then repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Before you head out and buy an a/c, there are a couple of things to decide initially. Where are you going to be setting up the a/c unit? If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How big should the air conditioning system be? Too big and you'll run into problems with short-cycling, which can harm the air conditioning unit and shorten its life. Too little and your air conditioning system won't be able to cool the house appropriately. When going shopping for a new AC system, these are simply a few of the factors that you need to take into account. Each option can and will significantly impact your system's performance, which is why you can't afford to ignore any of them.<p>
