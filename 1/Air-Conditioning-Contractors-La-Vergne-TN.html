<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit contaminants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Moist and humid conditions reproduce mold and mildew that can set off respiratory concerns like allergies and asthma. Depending upon your location, the hot summertime can produce particularly damp conditions. Lower the amount of moisture in the air and curb the development of annoying molds with a few well-placed dehumidifiers. There are a range of humidifier choices that will help preserve constant humidity levels and create comfortable living conditions in your house.<p>
