<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Contractors in Clay City</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>

<p>The first ac system and refrigerators utilized toxic or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could result in deadly accidents when they leaked.

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
