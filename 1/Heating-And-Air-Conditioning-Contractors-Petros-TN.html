<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roofing system, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, but it is likewise a choice for homeowners to consider.

Packaged units are great for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system independently, considering that the unit is combined.
