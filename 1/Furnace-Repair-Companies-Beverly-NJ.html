<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to find an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top, don't position the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it. Any air flow restriction will reduce the system's efficiency. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>

<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't emit heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place in time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>

The majority of units feature a set that consists of adjustable window extensions and metal mounting brackets. These parts will ensure an airtight and secure fit in the window opening. And for extra support, especially for larger ac system, think about acquiring a steel support bracket and install it to the outside home wall, straight below the windowsill.<p>
