<p>A geothermal heating unit does not create its power by burning fossil fuels such as coal, gas, or oil. Instead, it soaks up heat from within the earth.

Before we design and set up any systems, we set up a home energy audit in which an energy auditor will advise improvements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these enhancements. Standard improvements normally consist of adding insulation and air sealing steps. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can recommend a number of certified house Energy Star auditors and installation professionals. Please Contact Us for recommendations.<p>

<h3>Repair and Care for Maple Heights OH Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>Another approach to reducing the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your home is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside your home.
