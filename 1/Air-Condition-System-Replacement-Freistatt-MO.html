<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Important Service in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% effectiveness or better; it is not uncommon for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older designs, which may be ranked as low as 80% effectiveness, this can mean significant cost savings in annual heating expenses. Modern two- and three-stage heating systems increase performance even further by running at lower or higher capability depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of different heating unit, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by distributing warm water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
