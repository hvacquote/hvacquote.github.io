Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other elements that can affect this could be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

<p>A health survey must be established and dispersed to all worried employees. Such a tool must determine the number of individuals impacted; define ages and job descriptions of involved employees; identify where they lie within the office; indicate when the signs happen (time of day, day of week, and time of year); offer a list of particular health signs or diseases; identify all machines run in the office; indicate the type of outdoors air contamination; and recognize prospective sources of job tension.<p>
<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance products that only a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do.
