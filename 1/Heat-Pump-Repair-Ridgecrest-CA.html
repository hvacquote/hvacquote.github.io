OSHA, NIOSH and others have actually set NO2 standards, and the World Health Company (WHO) has set guidelines for both-- consisting of for indoor air.<p>

For instance, Warmup's StickyMat solution can be installed as a Do It Yourself job as it is basic to set with the electric wire being all pre-spaced and readily connected to the mesh, ready to be rolled out in place.
