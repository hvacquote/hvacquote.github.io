<h3>How To Eradicate Boiler Problems in Ward CO</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future.

Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur gradually because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick till you purchase a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
