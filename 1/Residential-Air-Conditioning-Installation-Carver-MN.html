<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
