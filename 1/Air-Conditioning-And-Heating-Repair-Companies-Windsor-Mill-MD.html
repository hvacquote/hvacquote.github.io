<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the very same. As soon as the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively cure and solidify-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
