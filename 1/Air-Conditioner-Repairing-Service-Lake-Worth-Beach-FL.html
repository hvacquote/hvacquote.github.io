<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young children can be serious. They consist of hold-ups in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, infants, and children are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than adults since lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the damaging effects of lead. Children may have greater exposures considering that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

<p>Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Damaging direct exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is incorrectly removed from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of airborne lead particles in homes can also arise from lead dust from outdoor sources, including contaminated soil tracked within, and usage of lead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>It's on days like these that the idea of an in-floor heater appears less like a high-end product and more like a requirement. (Besides, heated floors were good enough for the Roman Empire) But prior to you commit to what can be a significant improvement task, it's best to ask yourself whether a radiant flooring heating unit is a suitable service for your particular house heating requirements.<p>
