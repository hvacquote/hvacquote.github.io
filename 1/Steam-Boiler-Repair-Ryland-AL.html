<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner in Ryland AL</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
