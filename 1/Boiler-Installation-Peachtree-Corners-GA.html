<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>

And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
