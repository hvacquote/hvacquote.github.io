<h3>Ventilation Double Flux in Mizpah NJ</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
