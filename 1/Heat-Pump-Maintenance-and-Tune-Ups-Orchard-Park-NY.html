However, direct exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin through inhalation is not possible in many cases, as contaminants are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the released spores.

More major than the majority of allergenic homes is the capability of mold to set off episodes in persons that currently have asthma, a serious breathing disease.<p>
<p>Just like homes, the most crucial element influencing indoor air quality is the existence of toxin sources. Typically discovered workplace pollutants and their sources. include environmental tobacco smoke; asbestos from insulating and fire-retardant structure products; formaldehyde from pushed wood products; other organics from constructing products, carpet, and other office furnishings, cleaning activities and materials, restroom air fresheners, paints, adhesives, photocopier, and photography and printing shop; biological contaminants from filthy ventilation systems or water-damaged walls, ceilings, and carpets; and pesticides from pest management practices.<p>
