<p>. Prior to selecting the installation location of air conditioner, a number of primary elements need to be considered. First of all, the direction of air flow from the indoor units need to not fall on the place of rest or work area. Second of all, there need to not be any barriers en route of the airflow that might prevent it from covering the area of the premises as much as possible. The outdoor system should also be found in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be efficiently released outside and the efficiency of the whole system will drop greatly.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
