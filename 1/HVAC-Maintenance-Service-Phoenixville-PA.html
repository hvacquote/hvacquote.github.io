<p>Indoor contaminants. These consist of chemicals utilized in the construction or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these home appliances (cook stoves, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops need to be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices should be sealed and power-vented systems set up to eliminate items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also create particulates and must be vented outside.<p>

<p>The primary health impact related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
