Now the "tough part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
