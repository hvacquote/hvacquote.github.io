<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you need to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
