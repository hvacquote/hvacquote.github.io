The typical summer season temperature to reach the SEER ranking is 83 degrees, so to get to the appropriate SEER ranking for your area, subtract 2 points for every single 10 degrees over 83.

<p>We look at hints prior to we offer advice to replace rather than repair a heating unit. One of the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy bills are greater every year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more effective design, then you would be squandering money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more tough to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity must be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
<p>The predominant health result related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
