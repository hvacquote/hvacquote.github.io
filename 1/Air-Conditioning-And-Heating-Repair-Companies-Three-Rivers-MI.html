<p>When our furnace was passing away, we called two local companies for bids. While both were useful and valuable, Ballard Natural Gas provided us a better deal, for remarkable service. Rather than an easy sales job, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heater and located ways we might have more even heat.

<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company used 98% of the existing material purchased with the house.
