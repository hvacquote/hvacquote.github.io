<p>Geothermal heat pump cost is even more than other heat pump types when setting up the whole system. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Setting up one involved excavation, running hundreds of backyards of piping, burying the loop, and more. This procedure is rather pricey.

Itâ $ s just perfect.<p>
