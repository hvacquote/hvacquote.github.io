<p>The first a/c unit and refrigerators utilized flammable or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could result in deadly mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<h3>Recognizing the Significance of HVAC Systems at New Almaden CA</h3>
<p>When developing your brand-new house a well-functioning Heating and Cooling system is crucial, along with the air quality you breathe inside. We have the experience and resources essential to help from the preparation stages through to the last installation. We use the current software application to help create your ductwork system and use the highest quality products in the construction and installation.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
