<p>Current Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
