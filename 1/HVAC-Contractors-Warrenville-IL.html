<h3>Leaking Ductwork in Warrenville Illinois</h3>

<h3>Why You Want Air Conditioning Repair in Warrenville IL?</h3>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
