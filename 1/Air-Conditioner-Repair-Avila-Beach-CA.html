<p>We're spending a lot more time inside, nowadays. While many individuals assume contamination is simply an outdoor problem, your house (and workplace) can also be polluted. As a society, we ensure that our houses are well-insulated and well-sealed, but we don't believe sufficient about direct exposure to all the important things we put in our homes," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around buildings and structures has a big result on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, dizziness, queasiness-- right away, they can begin years after direct exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Here's how to breathe much easier.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a routine oil change in your car. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. Energy Star suggests changing your filter when every three months. Throughout high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
