<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system parts, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>

EPA and CPSC have actually banned a number of asbestos products. Producers have likewise willingly minimal uses of asbestos. Today, asbestos is most typically found in older houses, in pipeline and furnace insulation materials, asbestos shingles, millboard, textured paints and other coating products, and floor tiles.<p>
