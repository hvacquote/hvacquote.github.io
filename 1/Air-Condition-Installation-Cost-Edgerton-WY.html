<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heating systems, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
