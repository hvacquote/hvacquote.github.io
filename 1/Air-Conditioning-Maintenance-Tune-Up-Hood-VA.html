<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time.

<h3>Air And Heat Repair in Hood VA</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
<p>The bureau projects 34 percent employment development for HVAC technicians between 2010 and 2020, more than two times the average for all occupations. Several elements contribute to this, including the replacement and upgrade of older air conditioning systems to satisfy more stringent environmental regulations. The sluggish rebound in residential and commercial construction will develop a steady circulation of new opportunities, particularly for specialists who want to relocate. New systems are more advanced and computerized, so professionals who have finished formal training programs at a technical or neighborhood college may have a benefit over those who find out on the job.<p>
<p>Mobile houses are generally smaller than stick-built residential or commercial properties and use significantly less oil and a much smaller furnace to heat. Expect the typical mobile home oil furnace to have beginning costs of around $1,500. Remember that not as numerous brands produce oil furnaces for this use, and you may discover more alternatives with gas, lp, or electric heating systems.<p>
