<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more problems, since some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
