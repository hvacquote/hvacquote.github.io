<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
