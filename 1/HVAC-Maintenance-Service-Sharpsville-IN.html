<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside system as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>What to Look for When Selecting an Sharpsville IN HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really pleased that somebody as skilled as Adam had the ability to return and fix the air conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the ac system before you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to check AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood just what the problem was and fixed it really quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
