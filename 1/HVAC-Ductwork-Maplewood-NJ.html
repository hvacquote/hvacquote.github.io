If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. When going shopping for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit conveniently into the window, be sure to have those dimensions on hand.
