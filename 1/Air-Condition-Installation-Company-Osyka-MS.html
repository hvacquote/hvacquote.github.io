<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Osyka MS</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a relatively easy to measure surrogate for indoor toxins released by people, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are uncommonly high inside may trigger residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the primary indoor source of co2 in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Because an air conditioning unit moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both must be kept tidy. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
