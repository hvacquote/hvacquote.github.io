Throughout the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation.
