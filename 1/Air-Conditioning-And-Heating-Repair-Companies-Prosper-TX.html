<h3>Furnace Repair Companies in Prosper Texas</h3>

When checking your air conditioning equipment to turn off all main power from the emergency breaker panel or detach switch, always make sure. Be really cautious when examining capacitors, even with the air conditioning system off. Capacitors can hold a high voltage charge, even with the power turned off. An unforeseen discharge from an air conditioning capacitor can cause severe injury or death.<p>
