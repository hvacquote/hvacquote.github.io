<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise houses bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually seen the single-family home installation service completely turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter utilized to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to as much as 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not simply with beginners more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>

<p>They were great! Numerous HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally requested. They satisfied my needs totally by supplying a professional quote with choices, without pushing additional items. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and finished a little early. The also without delay followed up with the essential evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO protect the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor wisely, many of the 'reliable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>This evaluation is for changing a 17 years of age AC with a new AC, humidifier, air filtration system and thermostat. The technician who described our choices did an excellent task in making certain we understood the advantages and disadvantages of each choice. The technicians who installed the brand-new system were professional and quick, while taking time to make certain we understood how the brand-new system worked. Overall a first rate experience.<p>
