<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be severe. They consist of hold-ups in physical and mental advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Children, fetuses, and infants are more vulnerable to lead exposure than grownups because lead is more easily taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the destructive results of lead. Children may have greater exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>

<p>Excellent service within 24 hr and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely extensive in discussing what services would be carried out. Also Camryn provided terrific customer support at the end of the visit by describing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few tips of some maintenance tasks we may wish to have actually carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics used by some in the industry.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is taken in from inside your home and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Depending on where in the US your home is located, the local area's environment can change considerably. A house located in the South would require an AC unit with a size capable of cooling your home due to heat Summers. A home in the Northern part of the US would need a much larger heating capacity as well which will affect costs. See the chart listed below for the typical central air conditioning conditioner replacement costs by LOADS.<p>
