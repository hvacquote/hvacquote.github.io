<h3>Designing Tips to Central Heating Systems at Cedar Brook NJ</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the task based just on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few reasonable ones received. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install group was considerate of my home and installed the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post install evaluation outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New system cools better than the 13 years of age 4 lot R22 system it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
