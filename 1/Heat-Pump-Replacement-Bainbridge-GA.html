<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs silently and efficiently, however to have 2 major components fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance at Bainbridge GA</h3>
<p>First, unlike central air, you have a couple of alternatives when it pertains to central heating systems. We'll delve into costs later, however you can select from a heat, boiler or furnace pump. In basic, furnaces are the most budget-friendly alternative. Nevertheless, your option will mainly boil down to what your ducts allow or what was previously in your house. Ask your heating contractor for the most proper choice.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
