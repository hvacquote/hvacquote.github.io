PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have two different systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted separately.

Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor.
