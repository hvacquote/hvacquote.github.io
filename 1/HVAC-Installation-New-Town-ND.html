<h3>High Efficiency Furnace in New Town ND</h3>
<p>Today's house radiant heat systems maximize infrared radiation. By far, the most common source of a radiator in a house is the flooring mass. Radiators can be locally located in one area like a restroom floor or be installed across the whole sub-surface of the house's floors. Other radiators are still utilized, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating systems-- although ceiling radiators are usually used in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at risk. EPA estimates that direct exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and may cause thousands of nonasth-matic kids to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition intensified by direct exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to previously owned smoke causes nose, throat, and eye inflammation. It might impact the cardiovascular system and some studies have connected exposure to pre-owned smoke with the onset of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
