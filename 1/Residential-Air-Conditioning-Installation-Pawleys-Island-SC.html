<p>The icing problem becomes much more severe with lower outdoor temperatures, so heatpump are frequently installed in tandem with a more conventional kind of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized rather of the heat pump during harsher winter temperatures.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not offer them..

Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to appropriately service and the unit has actually been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
