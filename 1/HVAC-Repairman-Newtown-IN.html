<p>If the AC does not turn off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't emit heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can take place gradually since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick until you buy a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, go to Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
