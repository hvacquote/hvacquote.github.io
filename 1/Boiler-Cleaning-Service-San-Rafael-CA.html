Now the "tough part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power.

<p>Central air units are measured in tons. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
