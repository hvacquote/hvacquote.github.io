<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor system as close to your house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit require fairly little attention. But, similar to any mechanical system, some fundamental maintenance is necessary to keep the system functioning efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system are similar to those of conventional water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank must be looked for leakages, the system should be flushed regularly to remove tank and collected impurities (scaling in hard water areas). The systems need to be checked a minimum of twice annually for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be washed periodically to remove dust gathered in order to improve collector effectiveness.<p>
