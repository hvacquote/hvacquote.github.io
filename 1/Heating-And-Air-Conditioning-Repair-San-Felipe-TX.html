The choice of indoor units has one constraint: their overall power should not exceed the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units higher than the outside capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to anticipate better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, given that the total capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outdoor system. Basically, the outside system will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms might not have an extremely comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall power is not basic, considering that it takes into account not only the nominal power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
