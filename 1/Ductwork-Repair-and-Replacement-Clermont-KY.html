<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the space temperature level, and after that change it ON.

You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
