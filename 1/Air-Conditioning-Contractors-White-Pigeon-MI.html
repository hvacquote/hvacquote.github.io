<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most inexpensive. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
