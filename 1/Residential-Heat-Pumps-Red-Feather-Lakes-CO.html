Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 house has an unique DNA on how it collects dust and dirt. It takes about six months of close observation to see how frequently your a/c filter gathers dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better ideal choice on how frequently your HVAC filters need changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 houses have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 home, the less often you'll have to clean them.

<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the a/c system.

When the a/c unit works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
