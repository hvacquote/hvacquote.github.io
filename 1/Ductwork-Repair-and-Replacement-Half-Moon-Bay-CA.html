With no moving parts, it's comfy and very quiet, and it does not stir up as much dust and allergens, as compared to forced-air systems. It also does not develop any drafts, and getting rid of the need to blow air makes it more energy effective.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
