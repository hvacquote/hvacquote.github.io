<h3>Air Condition System in Sontag MS</h3>
<p>Seattle heating systems can run nine months of the year. Based upon the typical temperature levels in our location, if you compared running your furnace to an automobile it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its anticipated life expectancy of 15 years. Your heater will work hard for you, but like your vehicle, doing routine and regular maintenance will keep it running smoothly, prevent problems, and keep your service warranty undamaged.<p>
<p>Excellent service within 24 hours and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and very extensive in explaining what services would be performed. Likewise Camryn provided terrific client service at the end of the visit by discussing exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of ideas of some maintenance tasks we may wish to have performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques employed by some in the industry.<p>
<p>With the cost of electricity and gas increasing, it's important to have your furnace tuned-up for optimum energy savings. This will keep you from unnecessarily paying more than you should. Paragon Heating & House Comfort Solutions Combustion Optimization & Safety Assessment of your furnace consists of a Performance Check-Up, in which the thermostat is looked for precision and the burners are adjusted for optimal effectiveness.
