HVAC experts recommend following this standard guideline when deciding whether it's worth buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than required.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming common functions of environmentally friendly homes as part of the growing green building motion. Green tasks accounted for 20 percent of all newly constructed houses in the U.S. in 2015.
