Combustion products from auto exhaust, heaters, hot water heater, space heating systems, scented candle lights, oil lights, wood stoves, fireplaces, and gas ranges that are not appropriately vented can generate carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates.

<p>The main issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>
