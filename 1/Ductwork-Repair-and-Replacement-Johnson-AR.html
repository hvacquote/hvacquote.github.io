A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not have the ability to effectively cool the home on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
