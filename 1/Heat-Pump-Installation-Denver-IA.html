<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs silently and efficiently, however to have 2 major components fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
