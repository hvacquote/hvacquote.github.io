(If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker trips.
