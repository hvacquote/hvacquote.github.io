<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor unit as near to the house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>One of the downsides of central heating is that it's possibly costly to set up, particularly in an older house. Depending upon the kind of system installed, it can be noisy and trigger problems if you're extremely allergic to dust. In addition, specific fuels and equipment may require special authorizations, and there is limited flexibility in case of altered heating requirements. Throughout use, there is a time delay while heat is being carried from the heating system to the living space.<p>
<p>The toxins noted in this guide have been shown to cause the health results mentioned. However, it is not always real that the impacts noted happen at the pollutant concentration levels usually found in the house. Oftentimes, our understanding of the toxins and their health impacts is too minimal to identify the levels at which the listed results might happen.<p>
<p>To begin, it's a great concept to think about energy efficiency. By picking a central AC system that has as high of a performance ranking as possible, you can lower your carbon footprint and save cash in the long run.
