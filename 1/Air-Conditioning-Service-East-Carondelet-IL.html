<p>The predominant health effect connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
