<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers pollutants from indoor air (expressed as a portion efficiency rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute). A very effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less efficient collector. The long-lasting performance of any air cleaner depends on preserving it according to the manufacturer's directions.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside system as close to your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>If you think a mold issue-- either since of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature, and then switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
