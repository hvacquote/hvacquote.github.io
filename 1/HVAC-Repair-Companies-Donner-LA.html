<h3>AC Technician in Donner Louisiana</h3>

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a referral later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
