<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you need to examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
