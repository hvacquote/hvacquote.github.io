<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations.

Individuals at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
