<p>Another method to lowering the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the quantity of outside air coming inside. The majority of house heating and cooling systems, including required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather allows, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or cooking area fans that tire outdoors get rid of impurities straight from the room where the fan lies and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding noises. Though a lot of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems may be belt-driven. Squealing noises from a belt-drive air handler generally take place when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips. For the most part, the belt is poorly aligned or worn and requires replacement. Follow the instructions above under Air Conditioner Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's handbook.<p>
