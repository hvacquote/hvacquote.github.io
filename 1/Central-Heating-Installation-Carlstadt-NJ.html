<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the ac system back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, location 2 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your home will not warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
