<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
