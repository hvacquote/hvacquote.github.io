<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
