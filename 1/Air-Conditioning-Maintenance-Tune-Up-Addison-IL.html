<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and banned using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).

<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen over time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick up until you buy a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>
