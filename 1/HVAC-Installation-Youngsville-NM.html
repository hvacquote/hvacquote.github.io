<p>I'll begin with a gas furnace because it's the most common heater in Seattle homes. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your house by means of ducts, and cool air is gathered by means of cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for effectiveness. Older units from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively straightforward procedure. If you are including on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather costly.<p>
