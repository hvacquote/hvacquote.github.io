<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
