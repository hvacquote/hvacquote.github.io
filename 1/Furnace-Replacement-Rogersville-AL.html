<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was sort of odd being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. However after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with assistance, we fixed problems. I would suggest this item to anybody who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
