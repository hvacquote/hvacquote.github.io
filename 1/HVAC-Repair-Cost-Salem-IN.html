<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Picture 6).<p>

<h3>Direct Purchase HVAC Equipment in Salem IN</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the task based just on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of sensible ones received. Others were almost two times the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex properly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install team was respectful of my house and set up the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post set up inspection results look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 system it changed (likewise Carrier).<p>
