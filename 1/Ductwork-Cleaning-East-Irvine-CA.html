<p>Due to the fact that it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace.

Older systems from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively uncomplicated procedure. Installing a new gas furnace system can be quite expensive if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
