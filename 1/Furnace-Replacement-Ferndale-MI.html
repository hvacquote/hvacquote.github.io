<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Recent Review: They were great! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially asked for. They satisfied my needs totally by offering an expert quote with alternatives, without pushing additional items. The team appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The also quickly followed up with the essential assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
