<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor system as near to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
