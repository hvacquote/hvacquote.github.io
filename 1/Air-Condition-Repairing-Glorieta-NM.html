<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not get rid of the mold.

The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
