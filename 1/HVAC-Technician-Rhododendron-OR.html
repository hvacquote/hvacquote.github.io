<p>Your ventilation, heating, and air conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the possible to adversely impact your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and extremely small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should evaluate and, if necessary, upgrade the building envelope. For instance, he may seal spaces and cracks in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs. Insulation may be a more efficient option to your cooling issues than changing your devices.<p>

Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the wind nor the sun, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a readily available and trustworthy  source of energy.<p>
