<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
