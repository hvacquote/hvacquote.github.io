<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as important as a regular oil change in your car. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. Energy Star advises replacing your filter as soon as every three months. During high use months, check the filters at least monthly.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have been correctly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
