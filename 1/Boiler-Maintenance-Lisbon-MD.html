<p>I have been using them for years for my organisations, my own homes and my real estate customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with different costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again, he helped me problem shoot the concern. He is sincere, reputable, and sensible on cost. It's hard to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm happy I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
