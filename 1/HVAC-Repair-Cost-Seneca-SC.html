<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller house, which will impact installation expenses. Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other aspects that can affect this might be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
