<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets ask for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, much of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and kids can be serious.

Kids might have higher direct exposures since they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
