<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and check. Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
