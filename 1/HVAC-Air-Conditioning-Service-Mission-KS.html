Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire.

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
