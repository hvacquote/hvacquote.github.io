<p>The contaminants listed in this guide have actually been revealed to cause the health results mentioned. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily true that the impacts noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels normally discovered in the home. In most cases, our understanding of the pollutants and their health results is too minimal to determine the levels at which the listed effects might take place.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
