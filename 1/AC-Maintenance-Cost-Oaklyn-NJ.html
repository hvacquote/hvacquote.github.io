<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood simply what the problem was and fixed it very rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very practical in gathering information on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to briefly deal with the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and used clear interaction about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>
