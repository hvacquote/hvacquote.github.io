<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price great but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
