<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time.

In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
