Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the standard hot water heater can be shut down totally.<p>
<p>More common in reasonably older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes gas, electrical energy or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in private spaces. All-electric boilers can accomplish up to 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE.
