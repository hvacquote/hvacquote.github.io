<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

While the duct-cleaning market argues both research studies have flaws, no other research study has actually challenged the findings. And although the equipment and techniques used by duct-cleaning companies have changed considering that these research studies were carried out, the air ducts in homes haven't.<p>
