<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance at Tallevast FL</h3>

These systems can attain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just achieve an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). COP rates just how much heat a system produces or removes (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling effect. Most ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this implies is that for each unit of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, approximately 3 to 5 units are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>

<h3>HVAC Service in Tallevast FL</h3>
<p>I have been using them for many years for my services, my own homes and my real estate clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with different rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. When I called and he encouraged me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again, he helped me trouble shoot the issue. He is sincere, trustworthy, and reasonable on price. It's difficult to find a truthful AC guy and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
