<h3>Things to Consider When Buying a Heat Pump in Bensenville IL</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very pleased that someone as experienced as Adam was able to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to check the air conditioning unit before you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to test AC units even in winter. We want we had known him then.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electricity open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
