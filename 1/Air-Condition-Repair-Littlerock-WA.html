These convection heaters are still widely used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

Ventilation, a typical method of lowering direct exposure to indoor air pollutants, likewise will lower but not get rid of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.

In addition, the large boosts in ventilation it takes to substantially reduce direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy expenses substantially. Consequently, the most efficient way to lower exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the house is to eliminate smoking cigarettes there.<p>
