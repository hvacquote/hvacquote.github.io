<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a referral in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
