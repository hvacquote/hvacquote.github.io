<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, given that it is secured indoors. When it does require to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever.

<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your house that perfect temperature level all year round.
