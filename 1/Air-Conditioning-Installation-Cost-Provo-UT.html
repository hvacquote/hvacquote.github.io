In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Once you've got the ideal furnace selected and set up, you're going to require to keep it in excellent condition. Looking after your furnace doesn't simply involve repairing it when it breaks. You'll require to set up preventive maintenance for it as well if you want your furnace to live a long and efficient  life. Having an HVAC technician provide your furnace a tune up makes it possible to recognize and eliminate possible problems before they grow large enough to negatively impact its efficiency. You must set up preventive maintenance for your furnace at least as soon as a year.<p>
