<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very helpful in collecting details on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to momentarily manage the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and offered clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not produce heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place over time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay.
