<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. Because as much as 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless system has an integrated efficiency advantage. Due to the fact that they don't need any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Because an unit is set up in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>

Pressed wood products made for indoor usage consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furniture); wood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops).
