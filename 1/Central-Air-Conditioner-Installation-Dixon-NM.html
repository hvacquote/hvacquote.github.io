Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that protect your cooling system from flooding. One of the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a great chance; you may have a water leak in the attic.

There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on uncommon occasions.<p>
