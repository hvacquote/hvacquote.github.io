In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, however it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads.
