<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets ask for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, a number of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
