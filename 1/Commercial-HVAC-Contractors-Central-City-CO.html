<p>Many people undervalue the level of the indoor air contamination issue. Air contamination is usually visualized as the black smoke released from factories.

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
