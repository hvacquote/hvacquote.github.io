<p>Expert heating unit setups. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually stop working. HVAC experts recommend following this fundamental rule when deciding whether it's worth buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than needed.<p>

<p>Heating systems resemble vehicles. As they age, you can change one part only need another part changed or fixed next year. It doesn't take long to spend $500 just to keep an old oil or natural gas furnace running. Heaters incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives. Another repair sign is whether you had to wait to get parts replaced. As a furnace ages, it gets harder to source replacement parts.
