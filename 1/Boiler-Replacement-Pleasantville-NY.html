<p>Asbestos is a mineral fiber that has been used typically in a variety of building construction products for insulation and as a fire-retardant. EPA and CPSC have banned several asbestos products.

Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (permanent lung scarring that can be deadly).

<h3>How to Choose a Specialist HVAC Technician in Pleasantville NY</h3>
<p>Your lungs are accountable for bringing fresh air into your body, while simultaneously removing waste gases and particulates. Needless to state, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the more difficult it is for your lungs to eliminate them. Poor air quality - whether it is inside or outdoors - can make it significantly hard for your lungs to work correctly, and can have unfavorable health impacts.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
