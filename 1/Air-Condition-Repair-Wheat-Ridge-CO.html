<p>Because the 1980s, makers of HVAC devices have actually been making an effort to make the systems they make more effective. This was initially driven by rising energy expenses, and has actually more just recently been driven by increased awareness of ecological problems. In addition, improvements to the HVAC system performance can also help increase occupant health and efficiency. 21 In the US, the EPA has enforced tighter constraints over the years. There are several techniques for making HVAC systems more effective.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is taken in from inside your home and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>In the case of heated water or steam, piping is used to transport the heat to the spaces. The majority of contemporary hot water boiler heating unit have a circulator, which is a pump, to move hot water through the distribution system (rather than older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be moved to the surrounding air utilizing radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators might be mounted on walls or set up within the flooring to produce floor heat.<p>
