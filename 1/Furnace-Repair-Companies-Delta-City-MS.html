The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, however it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
