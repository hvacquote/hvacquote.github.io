<p>All houses require effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor might be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the right temperature level. Furnaces that kick on frequently may be because of a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>

<p>Your concerns or concerns about indoor air issues can regularly be answered by the government agencies in your state or city government.
