<h3>AC Technician in Micro NC</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
