Message or call service technicians to ask whether they can perform an assessment over the phone or perhaps over a video call.

<p>I am very amazed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years earlier and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
