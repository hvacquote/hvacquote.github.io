<h3>Indoor Air Conditioner in Lenoir City TN</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, given that it is protected indoors. When it does require to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical standards remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
