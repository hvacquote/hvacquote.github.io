<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978.

Bear in mind that the efficiency and effectiveness of your air conditioning system is greatest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the producer's requirements, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be harmful to the environment.<p>
