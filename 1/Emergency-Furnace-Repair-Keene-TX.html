<p>I have used around the clock for 5 plus years now. I have actually signed a yearly maintenance contract which covers 2 services every year. Ilan has been great through all these years. Always keeps my system tuned and serviced. Have not had any problems. Whenever he sees any concerns, he informs me about it and proactively fixes the parts. Really pleased with their service. Would advise them anytime.<p>

<p>When our furnace was passing away, we called two local companies for quotes. While both were useful and helpful, Ballard Natural Gas gave us a much better deal, for extraordinary service. Instead of a simple sales job, the owner of the company made a full assessment of our heater and located methods we could have more even heat. He consisted of these considerable however small changes in his bid. Due to the fact that of current warmer summertimes and for ecological factors, we decided to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>

Simply put, they are perfect for our Seattle climate! They are highly effective, beating out most other kinds of heating systems in efficiency. The only real exception to this would be a geothermal heatpump system. However, a geothermal installation normally costs tens of thousands more than an air source heat pump, which generally means it fails in terms of roi.<p>

Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year.
