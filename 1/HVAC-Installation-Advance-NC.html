<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do not accept them till they have actually been properly dried. Try a various dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine elements. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs dealt with by specialists, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Advanced designs of new houses are starting to feature mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the home. A few of these styles consist of energy-efficient heat healing ventilators (likewise known as air-to-air heat exchangers). To learn more about air-to-air heat exchangers, contact the Preservation and Renewable Energy Inquiry and Recommendation Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
