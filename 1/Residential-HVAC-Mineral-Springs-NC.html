<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System in Mineral Springs NC</h3>
<p>I have actually been using Waychoff for about ten years. First, they repaired a bad installation from a previous company. Thereafter, they have maintained my system semi-annually. Their techs are really experienced and expert. Expenses are affordable. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff installed a brand-new air handler and condenser today. I did not bother to get competitor's quotes because of my trust in Waychoff because the cost was certainly reasonable.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
