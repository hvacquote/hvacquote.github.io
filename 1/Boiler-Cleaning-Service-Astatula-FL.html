<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>

<p>In some cases a temporary indoor air quality problem is created simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's required, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more complex problems-- recognized by regularly undesirable air quality monitoring results-- will need a different tack. Depending on the concern you're experiencing, one of the 3 tactics below may be appropriate.<p>
