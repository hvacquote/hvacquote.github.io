<p>At present, EPA does not suggest utilizing air cleaners to minimize levels of radon and its decay products. The efficiency of these gadgets is uncertain since they only partially remove the radon decay products and do not lessen the quantity of radon entering the house. EPA plans to do extra research on whether air cleaners are, or might end up being, a trusted ways of minimizing the health threat from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, provides further information on air-cleaning devices to decrease indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in structures with poor IAQ might notice unpleasant or moldy odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for ac system repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you must check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
