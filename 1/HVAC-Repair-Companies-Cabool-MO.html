<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Basics in Cabool MO</h3>
<p>Another technique to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your home is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming inside your home. Most house heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window ac system with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or cooking area fans that tire outdoors remove pollutants straight from the room where the fan is located and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
