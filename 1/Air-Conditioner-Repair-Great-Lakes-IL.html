<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets ask for consultation and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. The likelihood of instant reactions to indoor air pollutants depends upon several elements including age and preexisting medical conditions.

Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do decline them until they have been appropriately dried. If goods with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent sees, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
