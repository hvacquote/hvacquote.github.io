<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash coming in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year.

Hope this helps.<p>
