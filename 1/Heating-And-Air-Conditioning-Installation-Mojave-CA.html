Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
