<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
