<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you need to look out for. First, you need to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
