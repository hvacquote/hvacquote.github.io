<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioner back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, location two 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single check out, or you can sign up for a maintenance plan with your local heating and air conditioning company.

Some companies offer top priority appointments to their maintenance plan members.<p>
