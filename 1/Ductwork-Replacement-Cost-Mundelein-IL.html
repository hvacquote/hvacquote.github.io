Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. Over time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ might discover musty or undesirable odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse, talk to your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for excellent building management.<p>
