<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you must examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
