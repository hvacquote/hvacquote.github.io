Setting up a multi-split system creates more problems, given that some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each space. However, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>

<p>A specialized ac system that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard ac system in that both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the same air path.

However, given that all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the same room, no heat is eliminated. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is in fact warmed, just as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
