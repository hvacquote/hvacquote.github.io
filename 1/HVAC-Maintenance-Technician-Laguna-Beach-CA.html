What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
