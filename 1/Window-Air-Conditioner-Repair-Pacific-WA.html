<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not provide auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in each month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There should not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
