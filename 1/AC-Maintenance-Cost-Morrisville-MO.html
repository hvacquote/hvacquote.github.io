<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
