<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to use vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement..
