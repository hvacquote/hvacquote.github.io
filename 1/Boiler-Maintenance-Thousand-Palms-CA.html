The collectors, piping and tank need to be checked for leakages, the system should be flushed periodically to remove tank and gathered impurities (scaling in difficult water locations). The systems ought to be checked a minimum of two times per year for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed periodically to eliminate dust gathered in order to improve collector efficiency.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a tube twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet.
