<p>Unstable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals released as gases from procedures or items; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The goal is to offer adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
