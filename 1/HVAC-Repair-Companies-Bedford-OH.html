<p>While radon in water is not a problem in houses served by the majority of public water supplies, it has actually been found in well water. If you have actually checked the air in your home and discovered a radon issue, and you have a well, call a lab certified to measure radiation in water to have your water tested. Radon problems in water can be readily repaired. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for additional information.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then determine the height and width of the opening. Make sure to have those dimensions on hand when shopping for an a/c to guarantee it'll fit easily into the window. Also, keep fire safety in mind when choosing where to install the air conditioning system: Do not place it in an egress window that acts as the only ways of escape must a fire appear.<p>
<p>The primary factor property owners do not acquire an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the quantity of services offered. If the system is brand-new and still under a maker's warranty, the cost might not be worthwhile. Any significant repairs need to be covered under the maker's guarantee. However, some producers require regular maintenance as a regard to the warranty.<p>
<p>Advanced designs of new houses are beginning to feature mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the home.

For additional information about air-to-air heat exchangers, call the Conservation and Renewable Energy Inquiry and Recommendation Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
