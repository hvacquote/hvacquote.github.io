<h3>Home Air Conditioning Company in South Gate CA</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in tons. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>The installation was fast, professional and very well done. The installers were courteous and understood precisely what to do. I am an engineer by profession and acknowledge quickly individuals who are proficient at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are great and do not miss out on information that creates a job effectively done. I extremely extremely suggest the 2 gentlemen as they are excellent at what they do. Thank you to them as they certainly deserve my thanks and gratitude for a job well done.<p>
