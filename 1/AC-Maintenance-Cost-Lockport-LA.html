<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. A ducted heatpump system might be most cost effective if your home or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Asthmatic kids are specifically at threat. EPA estimates that direct exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and severity of symptoms in hundreds of countless asthmatic children, and might cause thousands of nonasth-matic kids to establish the disease each year.

Direct exposure to pre-owned smoke triggers throat, nose, and eye inflammation. It might impact the cardiovascular system and some studies have actually connected exposure to pre-owned smoke with the onset of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor sensibly, much of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a similar score are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
