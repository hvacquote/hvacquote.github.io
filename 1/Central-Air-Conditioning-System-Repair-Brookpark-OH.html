<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems in Brookpark OH</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was needed and renovated the whole plenum and the duct for the hot water heater because the specialists believed they simply didn't appear right and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
