To make sure the system you select is the ideal size for your home, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load computation estimate to figure out the specific type of heat and a/c system that's ideal for your home-we do not just change it with the same size unit you presently have. These computations think about things such as the size of your house, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more.

<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the main issue. While installing a different split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
