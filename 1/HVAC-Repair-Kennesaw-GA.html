<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity professional at a large seller who asked not to be named since he did not have approval to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a team that routinely keeps track of energy intake and temperatures in stores to save money on costs (particularly in the evening) and to alert shop supervisors if temperatures in the shops vary beyond an acceptable range that might avoid customers from shopping at the store.<p>
