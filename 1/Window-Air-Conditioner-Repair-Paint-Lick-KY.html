<p>A specialized ac system that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, however differs from a standard a/c in that both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the same air path. A standard air conditioner transfers heat out of the room since its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, considering that all parts of the dehumidifier are in the same space, no heat is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is actually warmed, simply as by an electric heater that draws the very same amount of power.<p>

According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which results in the supply and elimination of air from inside a building." Those processes include bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
