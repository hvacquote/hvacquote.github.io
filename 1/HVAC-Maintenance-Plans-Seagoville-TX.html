<p>The very first air conditioning unit and refrigerators employed hazardous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to deadly accidents when they leaked.

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
