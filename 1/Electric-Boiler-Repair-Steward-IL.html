<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of noticeable development or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a hard task that the employees sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps men working. When a sales guy comes to your home he exists to offer, that is the only method he is paid. You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and should not "require" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on.
