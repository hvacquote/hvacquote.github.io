<h3>Outdoor Air Conditioner in Reisterstown Maryland</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

Packaged a/c unit often include electric heating coils or a natural gas furnace. This combination of a/c and central heater removes the requirement for a separate furnace inside.<p>
