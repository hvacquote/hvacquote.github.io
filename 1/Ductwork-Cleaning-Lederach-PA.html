<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize system won't be able to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run since it just takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently.

The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In truth, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
