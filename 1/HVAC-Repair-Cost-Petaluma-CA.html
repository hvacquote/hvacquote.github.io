<p>A packaged system, generally set up on the roofing, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, but it is also an option for homeowners to consider. Often times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those seeking to save money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, because the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are normally only readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a good way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best option for property owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
