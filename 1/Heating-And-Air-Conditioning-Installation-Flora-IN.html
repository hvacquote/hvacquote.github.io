<p>Another method to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the quantity of outside air coming indoors. Most home heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home.

Local restroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors remove contaminants straight from the space where the fan is located and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
