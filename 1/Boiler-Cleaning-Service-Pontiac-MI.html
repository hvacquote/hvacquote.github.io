<p>Expert heating unit setups. However, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately stop working. HVAC professionals suggest following this fundamental guideline when deciding whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a brand-new system, it's finest to buy brand-new.
