<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you must check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
