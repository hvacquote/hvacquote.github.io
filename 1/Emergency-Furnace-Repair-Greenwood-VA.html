Ductwork delivers the conditioned air from your HVAC system throughout your house through vents often found in your house's attic and However, with time ductwork can lose its' efficiency or might need to be altered to work with your brand-new AC system. New ductwork installation can tack on an extra cost anywhere from $1,200 to $4,200 depending on the level of intricacy to modify or set up. If you do require ductwork replacement, plan to include a few days of labor to your HVAC replacement task.<p>
