<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it extremely quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
