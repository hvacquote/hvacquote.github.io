In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather.

The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
