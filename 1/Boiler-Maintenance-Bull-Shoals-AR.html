<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, rather than commercial or outside settings. In jobs where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were popular in the very first half of the 20th century, especially in commercial buildings, apartment buildings and large houses. Many steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago remain operable, because the absence of moving parts makes them less vulnerable to wear and tear. A steam boiler replacement costs between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>

Air pressure distinctions developed by these forces move air-borne contaminants from areas of greater pressure to locations of lower pressure through any available opening in building walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is little, air will move till the inside pressure is equal to the outside.<p>
