<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is in fact warmed, just as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
