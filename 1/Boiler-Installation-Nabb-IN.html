<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Make sure all the registers in the house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the issue.<p>
