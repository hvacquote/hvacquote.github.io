<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives ask for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, a number of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
