<h3>Air Condition Installation Cost in Spanish Fort Alabama</h3>
<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a musty smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

It also does not develop any drafts, and eliminating the need to blow air makes it more energy efficient.<p>
