<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have been around because the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floorings and connected them into a warm water supply. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and an elementary pumping device to distribute hot water that warmed their stone floorings. In turn, the uniformity of the floor heat moved heat to other articles in the spaces, consisting of the human residents.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into houses through dirt floorings, fractures in concrete walls and floors, floor drains, and sumps. When radon becomes caught in concentrations and structures build up inside, direct exposure to radon becomes an issue.<p>
