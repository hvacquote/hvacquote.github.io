A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine elements. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs dealt with by specialists, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, typically described as central air conditioning" or split-system cooling", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, floorings, or ceilings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioner to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
