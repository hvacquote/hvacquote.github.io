<p>We're Not Simply Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to watch out for is the dust that collects throughout summer seasons. The best thing to do is making certain that the heating unit burners are examined and cleaned thoroughly before cooler seasons start. Always make sure that the furnace is cleaned up annually to prevent soot and condensation which causes burners to quit working properly. Possibly it is time to start thinking about purchasing a new one if your furnace is in a really poor condition.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. Since as much as 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless system has an integrated efficiency advantage. Due to the fact that they do not require any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Since an unit is installed in each room or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>

<p>You're most likely hearing the fan motor attempting to begin without the increase it requires from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can usually conclude that the capacitor has actually stopped working. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. However the chances are good that this may work for one cycle, but the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to change the capacitor.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
