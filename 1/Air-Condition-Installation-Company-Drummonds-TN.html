<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ might discover unpleasant or moldy smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for excellent building management.<p>

When customers require their HVAC systems repaired for relief against the heat and cold; service calls drop off when milder weather condition shows up, demand heats up throughout the summertime and winter season.<p>
