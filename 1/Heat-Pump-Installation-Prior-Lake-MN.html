Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a recent study by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground. But many of the things people do-- or don't do-- can add to the stew of airborne impurities in their houses and intensify asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>

<p>Reality: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceptionally rare now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>

<p>While toxin levels from individual sources might not present a considerable health danger by themselves, many houses have more than one source that contributes to indoor air pollution. There can be a serious threat from the cumulative effects of these sources. Thankfully, there are steps that the majority of people can take both to minimize the risk from existing sources and to avoid new problems from occurring. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to take actions that can reduce the level of indoor air contamination in your own home.<p>
<p>Our professionals are trained, experienced and certified to set up, maintain and repair commercial and residential heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment and to clean and examine your chimney or ventilation shaft.

<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a circulation system. Metal pipes are rarely used due to long-term destructive issues. Essentially all hydronic radiant flooring heat systems today utilize 1/2 inch diameter plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is extremely flexible, won't rust and can be found in long lengths, which allow PEX pipe to be woven with minimal or no joints.<p>
<p>The steadiness of the industry's growth doesn't necessarily equate to the experience of running an HVAC company. The heating, ventilation and air conditioning business tends to run cold and hot. When customers require their HVAC systems repaired for relief versus the heat and cold; service calls drop off when milder weather condition arrives, need heats up during the summer season and winter season.<p>
