<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
