<p>Reality: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>Even with the ideal system and appropriate installation, there's always the chance that your furnace will malfunction. While some problems are brought on by regular wear and tear, most can be traced to inconsistent maintenance. Furnace issues can create chaos in your home, specifically during the chillier months when you actually need to heat your interior. It's useful to understand how to troubleshoot common concerns so you can choose what to look after yourself and what to let a professional deal with.<p>
<p>Choosing the best size central air conditioning system for your house is very important, as is choosing either a package system, which keeps condenser, fan and coil all in one system, or a split system, which places the condenser outside the house and the fan and coil inside.
