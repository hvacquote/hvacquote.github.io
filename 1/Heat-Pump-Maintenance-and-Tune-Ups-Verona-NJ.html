<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
