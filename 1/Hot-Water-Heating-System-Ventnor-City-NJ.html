<p>The primary health effect associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may position threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
