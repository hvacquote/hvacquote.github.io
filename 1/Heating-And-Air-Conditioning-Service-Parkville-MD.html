<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated process. Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite expensive if you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
