<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside system as near your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
