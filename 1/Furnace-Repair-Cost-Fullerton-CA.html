<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that wetness needs to go someplace. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply asking for mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a efficient and straightforward method to lower ambient air contamination and possible health threats, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>Air toxins can vary from contaminants brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to dangerous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a common air toxin arising from gas that leaves into your home without being burned off. Older houses may consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In bathrooms and cooking areas, mold and mildew can end up being a problem where wetness levels are typically greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
