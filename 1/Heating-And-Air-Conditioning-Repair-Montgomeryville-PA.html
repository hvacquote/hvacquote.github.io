They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
