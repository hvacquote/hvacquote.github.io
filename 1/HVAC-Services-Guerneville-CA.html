<h3>Which Are Inverted Heat Pumps in Guerneville CA?</h3>
<p>After living in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the cooling. I went ahead and purchased this Carrier and I must say it does the job quite well. It takes really little time to heat up or cool off your home which is among the things we didnâ $ t get from the one we had before. The unit hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
