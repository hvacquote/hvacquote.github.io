The copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's more than likely your issue. The next action is to defrost your air conditioning equipment if you discovered that your conditioning filter needs changing. The most convenient method to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
