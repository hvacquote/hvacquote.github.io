<h3>Heating Duct in Conway MO</h3>

<p>I am changing our High Speed System because of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high speed supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an option for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Lots of AC systems come with a variety of unique functions that can even more improve performance and efficiency. For example, homeowners may want to search for one that comes with a built-in filter light that will signal you when the air filter needs to be changed. Another popular function to look for is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on in the evening to reduce energy expenses much more. Naturally, more functions imply higher central air conditioning costs.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must look out for. First, you ought to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
