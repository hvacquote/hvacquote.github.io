<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally caused by the absence of sufficient ventilation, which results in a buildup of pollutants from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health recognized inadequate ventilation as the main problem in majority the office indoor air examinations it has actually performed.
