<h3>Gas Furnace Service in Tehachapi California</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the property.<p>
<p>The fuel lines that provide gas to your furnace need to also be inspected regularly. Leaking gas and fuel can be a fire threat.

The maintenance. technicians will assess all of these elements of the furnace and thoroughly and eliminate all blockages and traces of soot.<p>
