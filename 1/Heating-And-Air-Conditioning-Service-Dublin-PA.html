<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Contractor in Dublin</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same contaminants. Simply put, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and kids can be extreme. They consist of delays in physical and psychological advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues.

Kids might have greater direct exposures considering that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
