<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release pollutants.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
