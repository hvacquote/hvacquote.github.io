<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material over time.
