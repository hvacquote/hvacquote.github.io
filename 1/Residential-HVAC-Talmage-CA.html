<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in loads. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.
