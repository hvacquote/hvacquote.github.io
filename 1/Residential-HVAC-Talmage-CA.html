<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in loads. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air.

Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>
