<p>My eldest boy always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I understood that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think of anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is low and itâ $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
