<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating equipment can last for years. But if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel expenses unexpectedly seem higher than typical, it is most likely time to consider a new system. New heating equipment is far more efficient-- you'll see lower fuel bills immediately, not to point out the money you'll save money on repair costs. If your heating system is 25 years old or more, you can most likely expect to cut your fuel bills in half.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years approximately. Loosen the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Photo 6).<p>
