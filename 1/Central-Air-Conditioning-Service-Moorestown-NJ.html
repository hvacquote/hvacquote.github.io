<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, typically set up on the roofing, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, however it is also a choice for property owners to think about. Many times, these units contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those seeking to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system independently, since the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally just offered for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a great way to save cash on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than purchasing just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best option for property owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
