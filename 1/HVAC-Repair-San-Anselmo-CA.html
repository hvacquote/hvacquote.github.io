<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the visit. They recommended replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap however a quick internet search validated WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working.
