The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation.
