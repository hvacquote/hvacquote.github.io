<p>A/c can likewise be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
