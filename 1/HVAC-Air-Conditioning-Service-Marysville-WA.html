<h3>Commercial HVAC in Marysville WA</h3>
<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As an initial step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor standards based upon the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor devices through codes, and after more powerful standards are set there is an opportunity to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>Some biological contaminants set off allergic reactions, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some types of asthma. Transmittable diseases, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transferred through the air. Mildews and molds release disease-causing toxins. Symptoms of health problems caused by biological toxins include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, sleepiness, fever, and gastrointestinal issues.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, typically described as central air" or split-system cooling", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the floors, ceilings, or walls covered by grills) bring cooled air from the a/c unit to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
