<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists if no pollutant sources are discovered. Extreme re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions. Stale air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. Stagnant air may also be a problem when ventilation is not sufficient to account for a boost in the number of workers in the location.<p>

<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Harrisburg NC</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even small window bundle systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Furthermore, really filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Oil heaters tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which needs to be effectively vented and cleaned up from the furnace frequently. Change the filters occasionally and have your ductwork cleaned up because the soot builds up inside the ducts, reducing their effectiveness gradually. Anticipate to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
