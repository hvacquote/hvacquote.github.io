<h3>Ductwork Repair and Replacement in Greenville MI</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss options. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Fantastic service within 24 hr and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was really thorough and on-time in describing what services would be carried out. Also Camryn provided excellent customer care at the end of the visit by describing exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few tips of some maintenance tasks we might wish to have actually performed in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale strategies utilized by some in the industry.<p>

<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose spent time repairing the issue, all the while describing everything to me.
