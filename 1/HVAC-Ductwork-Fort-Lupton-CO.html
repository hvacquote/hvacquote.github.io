<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Energy effectiveness can be improved a lot more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating systems. Zones are controlled by several thermostats.

In this case, the control system is extremely important to keeping a correct temperature level.<p>
