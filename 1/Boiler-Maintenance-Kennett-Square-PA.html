<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for assessment and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
