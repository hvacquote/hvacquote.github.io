The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
