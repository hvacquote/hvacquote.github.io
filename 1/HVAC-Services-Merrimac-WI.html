Today's heating systems are rated 90% performance or much better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective.

An example of time control is setting up flooring stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday.

These limits may not be proper in workplace settings or for the home.<p>
