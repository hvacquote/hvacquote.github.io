<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the flooring as a distribution system. Metal pipes are hardly ever utilized due to long-term destructive issues. Practically all hydronic glowing floor heat systems today utilize 1/2 inch size plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is highly flexible, will not rust and comes in long lengths, which permit PEX pipeline to be woven with minimal or no joints.<p>
<p>In the case of heated water or steam, piping is used to transport the heat to the rooms. Many modern-day warm water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move hot water through the distribution system (as opposed to older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air using radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be installed on walls or set up within the flooring to produce flooring heat.<p>
