<p>Excellent Product! Shipment was kind of strange being that package was opened and products could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we assured it was all intact. The product was exceptionally lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we resolved issues. I would advise this product to anybody who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time.
