<p>How climate change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary air conditioners) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system boost. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
