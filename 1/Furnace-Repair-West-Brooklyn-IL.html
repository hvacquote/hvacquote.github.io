<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity professional at a big retailer who asked not to be called due to the fact that he did not have approval to speak on the record, it prevails for big retail operations to have a group that regularly keeps an eye on energy intake and temperature levels in shops to save money on costs (particularly at night) and to alert store supervisors if temperatures in the shops vary outside of an acceptable variety that could prevent consumers from shopping at the store.<p>
