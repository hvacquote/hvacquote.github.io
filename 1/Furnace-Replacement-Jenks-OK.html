<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance.

After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
