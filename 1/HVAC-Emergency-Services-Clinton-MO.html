<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace at Clinton MO</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating system. We chose getting something more expensive than a standard water heater as gas is among our greatest utility expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate because it needs to run longer than a correctly sized system. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to run since it simply takes more electrical power to run a bigger system. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the needed moisture. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>
