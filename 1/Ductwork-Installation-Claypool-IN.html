They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Claypool IN</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things initially. Ensure all the registers in your home are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the lowered air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
