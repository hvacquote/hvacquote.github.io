The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
