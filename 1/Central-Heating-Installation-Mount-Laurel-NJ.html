<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Mount Laurel NJ?</h3>

<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things initially. Make sure all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>
