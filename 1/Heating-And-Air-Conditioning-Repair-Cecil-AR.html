<p>How climate change affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioner boost. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
