From the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some basic maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne toxins flowing through your system.

<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that may affect the health of individuals who reside in the house. Contaminants could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon going into your house from the ground listed below. An air toxin might also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile natural substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or personal care items. Bacteria and infections, family pet dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
