<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
