<p>While toxin levels from specific sources may not present a substantial health risk on their own, many houses have more than one source that contributes to indoor air contamination. There can be a serious threat from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Luckily, there are actions that the majority of people can take both to decrease the threat from existing sources and to avoid brand-new problems from happening. This security guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Item Security Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to take actions that can reduce the level of indoor air pollution in your own home.<p>
<p>Ask about training and accreditations. An excellent place to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification.
