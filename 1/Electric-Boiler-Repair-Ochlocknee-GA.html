<h3>Wall Air Conditioner in Ochlocknee Georgia</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95).

(He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
