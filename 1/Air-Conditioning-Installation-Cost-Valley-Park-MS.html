<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and likewise controling the temperature of the floor. All electrical wiring for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is unblocked and dry.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and accreditations. A great place to begin is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's sort of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Building Performance Institute (BPI) certification. Managers with BPI certification understand that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one aspect (out of lots of) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce toxins.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
