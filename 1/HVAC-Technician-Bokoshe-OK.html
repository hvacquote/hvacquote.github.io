<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips for Your Home in Bokoshe OK</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heater require fairly little attention. However, similar to any mechanical system, some fundamental maintenance is important to keep the system operating smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system resemble those of conventional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and storage tank must be looked for leakages, the system should be flushed periodically to remove tank and collected impurities (scaling in tough water areas). The systems ought to be examined at least twice each year for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be washed regularly to eliminate dust collected in order to enhance collector performance.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
