<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace specialists typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price great but Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
