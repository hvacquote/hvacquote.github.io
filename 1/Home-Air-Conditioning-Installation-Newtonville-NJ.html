<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that perfect temperature level throughout the year.

Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it likewise uses down your AC system, which can cause pricey repairs down the road. So, make sure to change your AC filters frequently, or get an air conditioning service strategy which usually includes a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
