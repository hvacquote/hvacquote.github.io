<h3>Knowing the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Spinnerstown PA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your air conditioning system and heatpump need to be without all blockages and debris. Obstructions can obstruct the flow of condensed water and cause moisture build-up within the system. Excess wetness can trigger problems like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the home, irregular temperature regulation, germs, and compromised air quality. A professional maintenance technician will flush and clean the condensate drain to guarantee all excess wetness flows away from the system.<p>
