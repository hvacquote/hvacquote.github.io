These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions require. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will require to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
