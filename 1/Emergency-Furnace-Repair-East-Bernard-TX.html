<p>Structures are created or intended to respond actively to some of these modifications in and around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sanitize, and keep surfaces to improve their performance, look, or longevity. In other cases, such changes subtly and even drastically alter buildings in ways that might be essential to their own stability or their effect on structure residents through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We might discover it beneficial to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, especially, some of the methods used by scientists studying environments, in order to acquire an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we spend the majority of our time, our structures.<p>
<p>We look at hints before we provide suggestions to replace instead of repair a heating system. Among the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy costs are higher every year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It may be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be wasting cash by not changing the older system.<p>

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
