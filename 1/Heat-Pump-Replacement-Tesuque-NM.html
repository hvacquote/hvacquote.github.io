<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical product over time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
