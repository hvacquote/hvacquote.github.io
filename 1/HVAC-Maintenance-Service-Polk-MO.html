<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our new furnace and AC unit. The best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they identified the problem and fixed really rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>The cost for heat pump installation also depends on the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, consisting of installation. Whole-house units, on the other hand, variety in rate from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation.
