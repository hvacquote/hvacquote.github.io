<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly reduces exposure to pollutants throughout cooking.

If you purchase a new gas range or range, think about buying one with pilotless ignition due to the fact that it does not have a pilot burner that burns constantly. Never utilize a gas stove to heat your house. Constantly ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in usage.<p>
