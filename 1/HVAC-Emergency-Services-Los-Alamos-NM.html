The heat from the hot water transfers to the flooring mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other posts with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and people. It does not count on heating or moving air to move heat.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do great work.

No extra charge.<p>
