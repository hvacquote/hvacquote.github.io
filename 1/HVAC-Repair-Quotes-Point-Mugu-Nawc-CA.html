<p>It might feel cozy being sealed in tight against the cold in your home throughout the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have respiratory problems, winter season can worsen problems. Stale indoor air and heating unit can increase the amount of allergy-inducing dust mites, pet dander, and mold spores circulating through your home. In late winter and early spring, it may still be too chilly to toss open the windows to take out the musty air, so while you await the warmer weather it is necessary to be aware of some of the allergy and breathing triggers that might be lurking in your surroundings.<p>
<p>Filters can get unclean quickly, particularly if you reside in a location that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all type of dust, particles, germs, and clean the air.

The cooling and heating will be inefficient and the indoor air quality will worsen. Checking and changing the air filters is among the most crucial elements of HVAC maintenance.<p>
