<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
