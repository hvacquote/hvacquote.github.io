<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. Gradually, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Prior to that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
<p>The primary reason house owners do not acquire an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the amount of services offered.
