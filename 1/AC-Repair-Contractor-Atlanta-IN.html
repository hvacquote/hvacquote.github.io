<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my companies, my own homes and my property customers' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. He assisted me difficulty shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again. He is truthful, reputable, and reasonable on rate. It's difficult to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year.

In truth, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
