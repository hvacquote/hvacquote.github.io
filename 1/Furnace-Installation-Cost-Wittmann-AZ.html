<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the task based only on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few affordable ones received. Others were almost twice the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex properly recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up group was respectful of my house and installed the equipment in the expected amount of time. post install examination results look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 system it changed (also Provider).<p>
