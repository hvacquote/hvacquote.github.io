<p>Correct ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same toxins.
