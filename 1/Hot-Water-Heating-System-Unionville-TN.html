<p>If you think a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
