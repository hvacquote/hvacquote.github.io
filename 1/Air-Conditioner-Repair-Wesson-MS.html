<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Advantages of Investing on Gas Furnaces at Wesson MS</h3>
<p>I admit I haven't done the mathematics recently, but I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine assessments. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the system sits. I seem like they give me favoritism, and want to pay a bit more for that assurance.<p>
