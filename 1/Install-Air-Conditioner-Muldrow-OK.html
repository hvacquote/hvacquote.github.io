There are a number of design methods in use today; nevertheless, all ground source heat pumps operate with comparable concepts. Every one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop in between the surface units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth.

<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level.

Prior to that happens, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
