Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up.

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
