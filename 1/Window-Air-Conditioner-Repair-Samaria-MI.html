At the height of the pollen season or when the air quality index is unhealthy, people with asthma may find being indoors offers the best relief, if the indoor air environment is good. Although air conditioning does not filter the air, it helps people with asthma due to the fact that windows and doors are kept shut, which helps keep pollens and other outside irritants and allergens out of the house.
