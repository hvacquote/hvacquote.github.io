PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have two different systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adjusted to offer heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the a/c unit into a heat pump While room cooling offers maximum versatility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is typically more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
