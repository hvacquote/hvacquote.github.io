<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew simply what the issue was and repaired it extremely rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of furnaces have numerous control boards. The largest, or just one in some furnaces, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and control of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the brand-new control board should be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t properly detected, altering a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable as soon as set up. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a pro to identify.<p>
