<p>The split system is the most common. The majority of people are used to seeing this type in the yards of houses. With split system units, the majority of the parts are housed in a metal box beyond the house. However, there are some internal components too. Split systems are ideal for cooling several rooms simultaneously, but are not very energy effective. Therefore, one pro is not having loud devices in the house. At the very same time, the con would be that those who use this might spend more money on cooling expenses in the long run since of the lower energy effectiveness.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, however it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level.
