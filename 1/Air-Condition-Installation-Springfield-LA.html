<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. Merely adding refrigerant is not a service if it leaks. A skilled technician should fix any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the right amount of refrigerant.

Refrigerant leaks can likewise be harmful to the environment.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
