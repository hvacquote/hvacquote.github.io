<p>When they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, many Midtown Houston Tx clients don't understand why their HVAC unit is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil.

The next step is to defrost your air conditioning equipment if you found that your conditioning filter requires replacing. The easiest way to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
