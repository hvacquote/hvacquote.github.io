<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate terrific but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not provide auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
