<p>There are 2 primary forms of glowing floor heating, or RFH as it's understood in the home heating company. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the flooring surface. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are required to withstand current, which then produces heat.<p>
<p>We suggest using our insulation boards when setting up over concrete pieces. When used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as a really effective thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile rather of allowing heat to heat up the concrete piece listed below.

Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
