<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Webster KY</h3>
<p>One of the primary reasons a furnace will run continuously is since something is dirty or clogged up Prior to attempting to repair any problem, take some time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". Inspect the furnace blower for obstructing and clean it if the air filter is excellent to go. If this does not work, have a look at the furnace blower motor and oil it. Contact a knowledgeable technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding sounds. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven. Screeching sounds from a belt-drive air handler normally take place when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips. In most cases, the belt is incorrectly aligned or worn and requires replacement. Follow the directions above under Ac system Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's manual.<p>

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also regulating the temperature of the flooring. All wiring for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the location is unblocked and dry.<p>
