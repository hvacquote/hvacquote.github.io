<p>When our furnace was passing away, we got in touch with 2 local companies for quotes. While both were handy and helpful, Ballard Gas provided us a much better deal, for exceptional service. Rather than a basic sales task, the owner of the company made a full assessment of our heater and located ways we might have more even heat. He included these small however considerable adjustments in his quote. Because of recent warmer summer seasons and for ecological reasons, we decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>

<h3>The Way to Avoid Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Whitehall MI</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they required to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heater. We selected getting something more pricey than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our biggest utility expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a pipe two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
