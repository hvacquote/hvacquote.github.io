<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the proper temperature level. Heating systems that kick on often might be due to a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a filthy burner.<p>
