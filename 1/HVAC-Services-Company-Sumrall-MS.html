Think about buying one with pilotless ignition due to the fact that it does not have a pilot light that burns continually if you acquire a brand-new gas range or variety. Never ever use a gas stove to heat your house. Always make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in use.<p>
