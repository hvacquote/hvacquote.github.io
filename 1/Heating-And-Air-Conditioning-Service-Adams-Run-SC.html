<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that just a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a homeowner doesn't have the tools or skills required to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and appropriate airflow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the essential devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still required to have a professional technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
